{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the full-text search in MySQL where the query does not return the expected results for the phrase 'the cat' can be attributed to the default behavior of full-text searches in MySQL. Common words (often referred to as stopwords) like \"the\" are usually ignored in full-text searches because they appear frequently in the language and do not contribute significantly to the context of the search. This could be why your search results are not including all instances of 'the cat'.\n\nTo address this issue, you can adjust the following parameters:\n\n1. **`ft_min_word_len`**: This parameter determines the minimum length of the words included in a full-text search. If 'the' is considered too short (default is usually 4 characters), it might be excluded from indexing and searching. Reducing the `ft_min_word_len` might help if 'the' is not being indexed due to its length.\n\n2. **`ft_boolean_syntax`**: This parameter allows you to change the operators used in BOOLEAN MODE searches. Adjusting this might help if you need to modify how BOOLEAN searches interpret certain operators or if you want to include typically ignored words.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters, you can potentially improve the accuracy of your full-text searches to include common words or shorter words that are otherwise ignored by default settings.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your query and the issues described would be:\n\n```json\n['ft_min_word_len', 'ft_boolean_syntax']\n```"}
