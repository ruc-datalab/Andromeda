{"res": "Based on the user's question regarding the behavior of the `NOT` operator in MySQL and its priority relative to the `<` operator, the user is inquiring about the precedence of operators in MySQL. The precedence of operators is a fundamental aspect of the SQL language specification in MySQL and is not something that can be altered via configuration parameters. MySQL's operator precedence is fixed and documented in the MySQL reference manual.\n\nTherefore, there are no configurable system variables (`parameters`) that can be adjusted to change the precedence of operators like `NOT` and `<`. The behavior described by the user, where `NOT 1 < -1` evaluates to `1`, is due to the existing precedence rules where the `<` operator has higher precedence than the `NOT` operator.\n\nGiven this, the appropriate response is that there are no parameters that can be recommended to achieve the desired change in operator precedence. The user would need to adjust their SQL queries to explicitly control the order of operations using parentheses if they wish to change how expressions are evaluated.\n\nRecommended parameters: []\n"}
