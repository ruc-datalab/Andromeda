{"res": "The error \"ERROR 1040 (HY000): Too many connections\" that you are encountering indicates that the maximum number of connections that the MySQL server can handle simultaneously has been reached. This limit is controlled by the `max_connections` parameter in MySQL. To resolve this issue, you can increase the value of `max_connections` in your MySQL configuration file (typically `my.cnf` or `my.ini`), which will allow more simultaneous connections to the server.\n\nRecommended parameter to adjust:\n```json\n[\"max_connections\"]\n```"}
