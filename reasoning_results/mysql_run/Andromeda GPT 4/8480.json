{"res": "Based on the issue described where the query still returns results including the word \"for\" despite the adjustments made to stopword and token size settings, it appears there might be a need to further adjust or verify the configuration related to FullText search parameters and possibly rebuild the indexes to ensure the changes take effect. Here are the recommended parameters to consider adjusting or verifying:\n\n1. **innodb_ft_enable_stopword** - This parameter controls whether InnoDB uses the built-in stopword list. Since you've set `ft_stopword_file` to an empty string to effectively disable stopwords, ensure that `innodb_ft_enable_stopword` is set to `OFF` to disable InnoDB's internal stopword list.\n\n2. **ft_stopword_file** - You've already set this to an empty string to disable the stopword file, but ensure this setting is correctly applied by restarting the MySQL server if not done after the change.\n\n3. **innodb_ft_min_token_size** and **ft_min_word_len** - These settings control the minimum length of the token that is indexed. You've set these to 2, but ensure these settings are applied globally and not overridden at the session level.\n\n4. **innodb_ft_server_stopword_table** - If you have a custom stopword table configured, ensure it does not include the word \"for\". If you are using a custom stopword table, verify its contents.\n\nGiven the adjustments you've already made, consider the following steps:\n- Ensure the MySQL server was restarted after making changes to the `my.cnf` file.\n- Rebuild the FullText indexes on the affected tables as changes to FullText parameters require rebuilding the indexes.\n\nRecommended parameters to adjust or verify based on your scenario:\n```json\n['innodb_ft_enable_stopword', 'ft_stopword_file', 'innodb_ft_min_token_size', 'ft_min_word_len', 'innodb_ft_server_stopword_table']\n```"}
