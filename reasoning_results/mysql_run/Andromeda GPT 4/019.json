{"res": "Based on the error message \"ERROR 1205 (HY000) at line 1: Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction\" and the context provided, the issue is related to a lock wait timeout during a transaction. This typically occurs when a transaction is trying to update a row that is locked by another transaction, and it cannot acquire the lock within the specified timeout period.\n\nTo address this issue, you can consider adjusting the following parameters:\n\n1. `innodb_lock_wait_timeout`: This parameter specifies the duration in seconds that a transaction should wait for a row lock before giving up. Increasing this value can help in scenarios where transactions require more time to complete due to complex operations or high system load.\n\n2. `lock_wait_timeout`: This parameter sets the timeout for acquiring any kind of metadata locks, including table locks. Adjusting this parameter can also help in managing lock wait issues.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to adjust in your scenario are:\n```json\n['innodb_lock_wait_timeout', 'lock_wait_timeout']\n```"}
