{"res": "For the issue described in your query where the division result is not showing enough decimal places, the relevant parameter to adjust is `div_precision_increment`. This parameter controls the scale of the result when performing division with exact-value operands. By default, it is set to 4, which might not be sufficient for your needs in precise financial calculations like VAT.\n\nTo ensure that your division results have a sufficient number of decimal places, you can increase the value of `div_precision_increment`. For example, setting it to a higher value will allow more decimal places in the result of division operations, which can be crucial for accurate financial calculations.\n\nRecommended parameter:\n- ['div_precision_increment']"}
