{"res": "Based on the scenario described where an error occurs when the number of connections exceeds 10 for multiple root users, and considering the information provided in the reference questions and manuals, the relevant parameters to adjust in the MySQL configuration to address this issue would be:\n\n1. `max_connections` - This parameter determines the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. Increasing this value allows more concurrent connections to the MySQL server.\n\n2. `max_user_connections` - This parameter limits the number of simultaneous connections that any given MySQL user can have. Adjusting this parameter can help if a specific user is hitting a connection limit.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to modify in your MySQL configuration to remove the restriction on the number of connections for root users are:\n\n```json\n['max_connections', 'max_user_connections']\n```"}
