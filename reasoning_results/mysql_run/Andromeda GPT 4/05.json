{"res": "Based on your query regarding controlling the creation of a MyISAM table without enabling deferred write, the relevant parameter from the provided information is `delay_key_write`. This parameter is used specifically with MyISAM tables to control whether changes (inserts and updates) to the table are written to disk immediately or delayed until the table is closed. Setting `delay_key_write` to 0 would ensure that writes are not deferred, meaning changes are written immediately, which is what you are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter for your query is:\n\n```json\n[\"delay_key_write\"]\n```"}
