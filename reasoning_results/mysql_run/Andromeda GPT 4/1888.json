{"res": "To address the specific requirement of suppressing only the warning messages triggered by a query like `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS \"abcd\";` without affecting error or note messages, you can utilize the `sql_warnings` system variable. Setting `sql_warnings` to `OFF` will suppress the generation of warning messages for SQL statements without impacting the logging of errors or notes. This approach allows you to selectively control the visibility of warnings without completely disabling other types of messages.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your query and the provided documentation are:\n\n```json\n['sql_warnings']\n```"}
