{"res": "The issue you're experiencing where data inserted into the table appears as 'NULL' when queried could be due to several reasons. Here are some potential causes and the corresponding database parameters that might influence this behavior:\n\n1. **Data Type Mismatch**: If the data type of the column `data` in your table `large_data` does not match the type of `@large_data`, the database might implicitly convert the value to `NULL`. Ensure that the data types are compatible.\n\n2. **SQL Mode**: MySQL's SQL mode can affect how data validation occurs. For instance, if strict SQL mode is enabled (`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` or `STRICT_ALL_TABLES`), MySQL will not insert incorrect data and instead produce an error. However, if this mode is not enabled, MySQL might convert invalid data to `NULL` and insert it without an error.\n\n3. **Connection Issues or Query Errors**: If there's an issue with how the query is executed or if the session variable (`@large_data`) is not properly set within the same session or before the insert operation, it might not hold the expected value.\n\nGiven the description and the potential influence of SQL mode on data handling and validation, the recommended parameter to check and possibly adjust is:\n\n- **`sql_mode`**\n\nThis parameter can be configured to ensure stricter data checks, which can help in avoiding implicit data conversion to `NULL` under certain conditions. Adjusting the SQL mode to include strict settings might help in identifying if there's a data handling issue that's causing your `NULL` values.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters list based on your query and the potential issues discussed is:\n\n```json\n[\"sql_mode\"]\n```"}
