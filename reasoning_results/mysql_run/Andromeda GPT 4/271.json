{"res": "Based on the information provided and the specific issue of managing the size of the `ibtmp1` file without restarting the MySQL server, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n1. **innodb_temp_data_file_path** - This parameter allows you to specify the location and size of the temporary tablespace data file (`ibtmp1`). Adjusting this might help manage how space is allocated initially.\n\n2. **innodb_file_per_table** - Enabling this parameter ensures that each InnoDB table has its own .ibd file, which can help manage individual file sizes better and prevent the `ibtmp1` file from growing too large as it does not include data from individual tables.\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the management of InnoDB files, including temporary tablespace files like `ibtmp1`. Adjusting these settings can help control disk space usage without needing to restart the MySQL server."}
