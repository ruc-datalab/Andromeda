{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you provided and the issues you are facing with foreign key constraints, order of table operations, and the error encountered during data re-import, the following parameters are recommended to address these concerns:\n\n1. **foreign_key_checks** - This parameter should be adjusted to disable foreign key checks temporarily when you are deleting or importing tables in an order that does not respect the foreign key constraints. This will prevent errors related to foreign key constraints during these operations.\n\n2. **autocommit** - Adjusting this parameter can help manage transaction boundaries more effectively, especially when performing bulk delete or insert operations. It can be set to off to group several SQL commands into a single transaction to ensure data integrity.\n\nThe recommended parameters based on your scenario and the reference documentation are:\n\n```json\n[\"foreign_key_checks\", \"autocommit\"]\n```"}
