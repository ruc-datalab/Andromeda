{"res": "The issue you're encountering where the query `SELECT * FROM test1 WHERE id IS NULL;` returns a row with an `id` of 1 and `name` of 'booboo' instead of an empty result set is likely due to a misunderstanding of how the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute works in MySQL. When you insert a row into a table with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, MySQL automatically assigns the next sequential integer to the `id` field, starting from 1 by default. Therefore, unless explicitly set to `NULL` (and the table is designed to accept `NULL` values in the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, which is unusual and generally not recommended), the `id` will never be `NULL`.\n\nGiven the nature of your question and the details provided, it seems there might be confusion about how `AUTO_INCREMENT` and query conditions work. However, since you asked for parameters based on the reference questions and manuals, and considering the general context of database configuration, here are some relevant parameters:\n\n1. **`auto_increment_increment`** - This parameter controls the increment between successive `AUTO_INCREMENT` values. It's relevant to your mention of `AUTO_INCREMENT`, although it doesn't directly address the query issue.\n\n2. **`sql_mode`** - This parameter can influence how MySQL handles different SQL syntaxes and behaviors, including strictness and error handling. It doesn't directly solve the issue described but is a critical parameter for overall SQL behavior management.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their relevance to the broader topics of `AUTO_INCREMENT` handling and SQL behavior, which seem to be areas of confusion or interest in your scenario. Adjusting these might not resolve the misunderstanding about the `NULL` query but could be useful for managing how your database handles auto-incrementation and SQL execution standards."}
