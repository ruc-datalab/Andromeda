{"res": "Based on the context and the issues described in your query, the relevant MySQL parameters that could potentially influence the behavior of your encryption and decryption operations are:\n\n1. **block_encryption_mode** - This parameter is crucial as it defines the encryption algorithm and mode used. Since you are using an initialization vector, the encryption mode likely needs to support block cipher modes that utilize IVs, such as CBC.\n\n2. **character_set_connection** - This parameter determines the character set used for the connection, which can affect how binary data (like encrypted data) is handled and interpreted when being sent to and from the client.\n\n3. **collation_connection** - Similar to character_set_connection, this affects how string comparisons and operations are interpreted, which might influence the handling of binary/encrypted data.\n\nGiven the operations and issues described, these parameters are the most relevant to check and potentially adjust to resolve issues with decryption resulting in null or unexpected blob data. Here is the list of recommended parameters:\n\n```plaintext\n['block_encryption_mode', 'character_set_connection', 'collation_connection']\n```"}
