{"res": "Based on the information provided and the specific request to disable warning logs that might impact performance during the execution of the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command, the relevant parameters to consider are those that control the logging of warnings and error verbosity. From the documentation and previous discussions, the parameters that can be adjusted to suppress warnings are:\n\n- `log_error_verbosity`: This parameter controls the verbosity of the error log. Setting it to a lower level can reduce the number of warnings logged.\n- `log_warnings`: This parameter, when set to 0, suppresses the logging of some warnings.\n\nGiven the scenario described where warnings are logged for each row during the import process but are not needed, adjusting these parameters can help manage the performance impact of logging. Therefore, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n[\"log_error_verbosity\", \"log_warnings\"]\n```"}
