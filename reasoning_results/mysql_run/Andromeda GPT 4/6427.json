{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario and the issues described, the relevant database parameter that could be influencing the behavior of the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function in your query is:\n\n- `group_concat_max_len`\n\nThis parameter determines the maximum length of the result of the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function. Although in your case, the length of the concatenated `id` values does not exceed the default limit, it's important to ensure that this setting is sufficiently large to handle potential future cases where concatenated results might be longer.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to check and possibly adjust is:\n\n```['group_concat_max_len']```"}
