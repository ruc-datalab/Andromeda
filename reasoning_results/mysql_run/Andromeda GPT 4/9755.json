{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issue described, it seems there is a misunderstanding about the scope of the variable setting. The `auto_increment_offset` variable can be set at both the global and session levels. When you set it as root using `set @@auto_increment_offset = 2;`, you are setting it for the current session unless you explicitly specify it as a global setting. This is why the change is not visible from other connections, as they have their own session settings or use the global default if not set in their session.\n\nTo ensure that the `auto_increment_offset` is set globally and affects all clients without needing to restart the MySQL server, you should use the `GLOBAL` keyword when setting the variable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL auto_increment_offset = 2;\n```\n\nThis command will change the value of `auto_increment_offset` globally, affecting all new connections after the change. Existing connections will need to either adopt the global setting or set their session variable if needed.\n\nTherefore, the relevant parameter to recommend based on your query and the documentation provided is:\n\n```json\n[\"auto_increment_offset\"]\n```"}
