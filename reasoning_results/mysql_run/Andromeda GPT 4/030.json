{"res": "The error you are encountering when trying to execute the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command, which states \"Failed to open file '/lib/schema.sql', error: 2,\" typically indicates a problem related to file access or file path issues. The error code \"2\" usually means \"No such file or directory.\" This can occur if the file path is incorrect, the file does not exist at the specified location, or the MySQL server does not have permission to access the file.\n\nGiven the context of your query and the related issues in the reference questions, the most relevant MySQL parameter to consider is:\n\n- `secure_file_priv`: This parameter restricts the directories from which files can be loaded and into which files can be dumped. If this parameter is set, it limits the file paths that can be used with the `LOAD DATA INFILE` and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` commands.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to check and possibly adjust in your MySQL configuration to resolve the file access issue is:\n\n```json\n[\"secure_file_priv\"]\n```"}
