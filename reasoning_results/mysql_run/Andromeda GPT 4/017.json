{"res": "Based on the details provided and the performance metrics from the mysqlslap benchmark, it seems that the MySQL container might benefit from adjustments to parameters that influence memory allocation, query processing, and disk I/O operations. Here are the recommended parameters to potentially improve the performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter can help improve the performance for InnoDB tables by reducing disk I/O. Given that you are running a container, ensure that the allocated size does not exceed the container's available memory.\n\n2. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters determine the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that exceed this size will be converted to on-disk tables, which are slower. Adjusting these parameters can reduce disk I/O for complex queries that involve sorting or temporary tables.\n\n3. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter determines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many already there. Reusing threads can be faster than creating new ones.\n\n4. **table_open_cache** and **table_open_cache_instances**: These parameters control the number of tables the server can keep open. Increasing these values can improve performance if your workload involves accessing a large number of tables.\n\n5. **query_cache_size** and **query_cache_type**: If your workload involves many identical queries, enabling and tuning the query cache can result in performance improvements by serving query results from memory. Note that the query cache is deprecated in MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0.\n\n6. **key_buffer_size**: For MyISAM tables, this parameter adjusts the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Increasing it can improve the performance of index reading for MyISAM tables.\n\n7. **join_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer used for joins that do not use indexes. Increasing it can improve the performance of such queries.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter sets the amount of memory that can be used for sorting results. Increasing it can help speed up sorting operations.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size** and **read_rnd_buffer_size**: These parameters control the size of the buffers used for sequential and random read operations. Tuning these can help reduce disk I/O.\n\nGiven the parameters and the nature of your workload, consider adjusting the following settings in your MySQL configuration:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"table_open_cache_instances\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\"\n]\n```"}
