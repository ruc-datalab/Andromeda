{"res": "The error you're encountering in the query `select count (*) from grades;` is due to incorrect syntax. In MySQL, the correct syntax does not allow a space between `count` and the parentheses. The correct form is `select count(*) from grades;`.\n\nThe error message you received is related to SQL syntax, and the parameter that can influence how MySQL interprets SQL syntax is `sql_mode`. However, in this case, modifying `sql_mode` would not resolve the issue because the syntax error is due to a fundamental SQL syntax rule that is not affected by `sql_mode` settings. The error is strictly due to the incorrect placement of a space, which is not something that can be adjusted through configuration parameters.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is to correct the syntax of the query itself by removing the space between `count` and the parentheses. There are no configuration parameters that would allow the incorrect syntax `select count (*) from grades;` to execute successfully.\n\nBased on the context of your question and the parameters discussed in the provided documentation and user questions, the relevant parameter to consider for general SQL syntax issues is `sql_mode`. However, as explained, it does not apply to this specific syntax error.\n\nRecommended parameters based on the context of SQL syntax issues:\n```json\n['sql_mode']\n```"}
