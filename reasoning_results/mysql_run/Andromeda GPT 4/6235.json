{"res": "Based on the details provided in the query and the related documentation, the issue seems to be related to how MySQL handles division operations and the precision of the results. The parameter that directly influences the scale of the result in division operations involving exact-value operands is `div_precision_increment`. This parameter determines the number of decimal places in the result of a division operation when using exact-value operands.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem described, where the precision of the result from a division operation is crucial and seems to be causing unexpected truncation or formatting of the result, adjusting the `div_precision_increment` parameter could help in achieving the desired precision in the results.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to address the issue described in the query is:\n- `div_precision_increment`\n\nThis parameter should allow for control over the precision of decimal results in division operations, potentially resolving the issue with the unexpected truncation to zero or inadequate significant figures in the results.\n\nOutput list: `['div_precision_increment']`"}
