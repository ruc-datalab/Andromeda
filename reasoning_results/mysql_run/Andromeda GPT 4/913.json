{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the related information from the documentation and previous questions, the relevant parameters to consider for your issue with the MySQL slow query log are:\n\n1. **long_query_time** - This parameter defines the threshold in seconds for what is considered a slow query. You mentioned it is set to 10, but you are seeing queries logged that execute much faster than this.\n\n2. **log-queries-not-using-indexes** - This parameter causes queries that do not use indexes to be logged in the slow query log, regardless of the execution time. This could explain why queries with very short execution times are appearing in your slow query log.\n\nGiven the symptoms you described, these parameters are directly relevant to addressing the issue of queries being logged that do not meet the expected threshold set by `long_query_time`. Adjusting these settings or understanding their implications should help in managing the entries in your slow query log more effectively.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```plaintext\n['long_query_time', 'log-queries-not-using-indexes']\n```"}
