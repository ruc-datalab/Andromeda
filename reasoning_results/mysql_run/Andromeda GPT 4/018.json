{"res": "Based on the information provided and the symptoms of frequent disk I/O operations affecting performance, the following parameters are recommended to optimize and potentially reduce disk I/O operations in your MySQL configuration:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing the InnoDB buffer pool size allows more data to be held in memory, reducing the need for disk reads. Since you are experiencing high disk I/O, ensuring that this value is optimally set relative to your system's RAM (without exceeding available memory) can be beneficial.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size**: For MyISAM tables, increasing the key buffer size allows more index data to be stored in memory, reducing disk I/O for index lookups.\n\n3. **query_cache_size**: Although deprecated in later versions of MySQL, if you are using a version that supports it, adjusting the query cache size can help reduce disk I/O by storing the result set of frequent queries in memory.\n\n4. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables for sorting or subquery operations will use disk-based tables if they exceed these sizes, leading to increased I/O. Adjusting these values can help keep more temporary table operations in memory.\n\n5. **innodb_log_file_size**: This parameter determines the size of the InnoDB redo log files. Larger log files reduce the frequency of disk writes for transaction logs but require careful tuning as very large log files can increase recovery time.\n\n6. **innodb_flush_method**: Setting this to `O_DIRECT` can reduce I/O overhead by allowing InnoDB to write directly to disk, bypassing the operating system's buffer cache.\n\n7. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value can reduce disk I/O by decreasing the frequency of opening and closing tables.\n\n8. **thread_cache_size**: Adjusting this parameter can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads for connections, indirectly affecting performance and I/O operations.\n\nGiven your scenario and the need to optimize disk I/O, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"key_buffer_size\", \"query_cache_size\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\", \"innodb_log_file_size\", \"innodb_flush_method\", \"table_open_cache\", \"thread_cache_size\"]\n```"}
