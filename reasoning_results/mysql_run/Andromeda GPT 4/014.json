{"res": "To optimize the performance of the MySQL PROCEDURE used for inserting a large number of rows sequentially into your `test_table`, you can consider adjusting the following MySQL parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - Increasing this parameter can help improve the performance of InnoDB tables by allowing more data to be stored in memory, reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **bulk_insert_buffer_size** - This parameter helps in speeding up INSERT operations for bulk data loading into MyISAM tables. Although your table uses InnoDB, adjusting similar parameters for InnoDB like `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` (if dealing with AUTO_INCREMENT) might help.\n\n3. **max_allowed_packet** - Increasing this parameter allows larger packets of information to be sent in a single network interaction, which can be beneficial when dealing with large data sets.\n\n4. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter is used for MyISAM tables to cache indexes. If any part of your operations involves MyISAM tables or temporary tables that might use MyISAM, adjusting this could be beneficial.\n\n5. **sync_binlog** - If binary logging is enabled and you are not concerned about exact point-in-time recovery, setting this to a higher value or 0 can reduce disk I/O wait times.\n\n6. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit** - Adjusting this parameter can help balance between durability and performance. Setting it to 2 can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file and flushing it to disk once per second.\n\n7. **innodb_log_buffer_size** - Increasing the size of the log buffer allows more transactions to be stored in memory before being flushed to the log file, reducing disk writes.\n\n8. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode** - Setting this to 2 (interleaved lock mode) can improve the performance of AUTO_INCREMENT handling in high concurrency scenarios.\n\nGiven your scenario where you are inserting data sequentially and the table uses InnoDB, the most relevant parameters to consider adjusting would be `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `max_allowed_packet`, `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`, and `innodb_log_buffer_size`.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'max_allowed_packet', 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit', 'innodb_log_buffer_size']\n```"}
