The current setting points to `C:/xampp/mysql/data/mysql.log`, which can be used or changed as needed.\n3. **`log_output`**: This is set to `FILE`, which is appropriate for logging to a file as required.\n\nThese parameters will ensure that all queries executed by the application are logged, allowing the user to review them as needed. Here is the recommended list of parameters:\n\n```json\n['general_log', 'general_log_file', 'log_output']\n```"}
