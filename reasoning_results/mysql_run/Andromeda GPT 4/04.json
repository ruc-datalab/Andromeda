{"res": "Based on the scenario described where the MySQL server is experiencing high throughput and strain due to large data tables and extensive use of \"select *\" queries that return many rows, the following parameters from the provided information can be recommended to help manage and optimize the server's performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - Increasing this parameter can help accommodate more data in the buffer pool, reducing the need for disk I/O and improving query performance, especially for large datasets.\n\n2. **tmp_table_size** - Adjusting this parameter can help manage the temporary table sizes in memory before they are converted to on-disk tables, which is crucial when dealing with large query results.\n\n3. **max_connections** - Configuring this parameter can help control the number of simultaneous connections to the server, thus managing the server load and preventing overutilization of resources.\n\n4. **sort_buffer_size** - Increasing this parameter can improve the efficiency of sorting operations, which are common in \"select *\" queries that return a large number of rows.\n\n5. **read_buffer_size** - Adjusting this parameter can optimize the amount of data read from disk in each block, improving the performance of large table scans.\n\n6. **innodb_old_blocks_time** - Tuning this parameter can help in managing how quickly old blocks are moved out of the buffer pool, which can be beneficial in environments with frequent large scans causing churn.\n\n7. **innodb_read_ahead_threshold** - Configuring this parameter can optimize the conditions under which InnoDB performs read-ahead to anticipate needed data, reducing I/O operations for large data accesses.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their relevance to the issues of handling large datasets, managing memory and I/O efficiently, and controlling server load, all of which are pertinent to the described scenario of high throughput and extensive data retrieval operations. Adjusting these settings should help in mitigating the strain on server resources and improving overall performance."}
