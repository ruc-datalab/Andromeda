{"res": "The error you encountered, \"ERROR 1175 (HY000): You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column,\" is due to the MySQL server being in safe update mode. In this mode, MySQL prevents execution of UPDATE or DELETE statements that do not include a WHERE clause that uses a key column or do not limit the row count. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental updates or deletions of large numbers of rows.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either:\n\n1. Modify your DELETE statement to include a WHERE clause that uses a key column. For example:\n   ```sql\n   DELETE FROM t_test1 WHERE id > 0;\n   ```\n\n2. Temporarily disable the safe update mode for your session, execute the DELETE statement, and then re-enable it. You can do this with the following commands:\n   ```sql\n   SET sql_safe_updates = 0;\n   DELETE FROM t_test1;\n   SET sql_safe_updates = 1;\n   ```\n\nGiven the context of your query and the error message, the relevant parameter to recommend based on the provided information is:\n\n- `sql_safe_updates`\n\nThus, the output list of recommended parameters is:\n```json\n[\"sql_safe_updates\"]\n```"}
