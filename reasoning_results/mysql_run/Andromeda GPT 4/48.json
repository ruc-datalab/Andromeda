{"res": "Based on the details provided and the issues described with character encoding mismatches between MySQL and PHP outputs, the recommended parameters to focus on would be those that ensure the character set used in the database connection, client, and results are consistently set to UTF-8. This will help in maintaining the integrity of the UTF-8 encoded data from the database to the web output.\n\nThe parameters to be recommended are:\n\n- `character_set_client`\n- `character_set_connection`\n- `character_set_results`\n\nThese parameters should be set to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' (if full Unicode support is needed) to ensure that the data fetched from the MySQL database is not improperly converted or misinterpreted when processed by PHP and sent to the browser.\n\nThus, the output list of recommended parameters is:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n```"}
