{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where memory usage spikes during the \"optimize table\" command and then returns to normal after a restart, it seems that the memory usage is temporarily increasing due to the operations performed during table optimization. This is expected behavior as MySQL needs to allocate additional memory to rebuild and optimize the table, especially if it's a large table with many indexes.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the operations, here are some recommended parameters that could potentially help in managing memory usage more efficiently or improving the performance of the MySQL server in your Docker container:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - Since you have a large table, ensuring that the InnoDB buffer pool is adequately sized to hold your data and indexes can improve performance. However, since you mentioned a spike during optimization, this setting might already be sufficiently high.\n\n2. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. MySQL uses these temporary tables for complex sorts, joins, and other operations. If these tables exceed the sizes defined here, MySQL will convert them to on-disk tables, which are slower. Adjusting these might help manage memory during intensive operations like \"optimize table\".\n\n3. **sort_buffer_size** - This parameter determines the size of the buffer that is allocated for each sort operation that MySQL needs to perform. Since optimizing tables can involve sorting, increasing this might help, but be cautious as each thread that performs a sort operation will allocate a buffer of this size.\n\n4. **key_buffer_size** - If your large table is using the MyISAM storage engine, increasing this can improve index processing performance during optimization. However, for InnoDB tables, this setting is not relevant.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size** - This parameter can help reduce overhead by caching threads. After a thread is used, it is placed in the cache if there is space; subsequent connections can use the threads from the cache, reducing the need to create new threads.\n\n6. **table_open_cache** - Increasing this value increases the number of open tables for all threads. MySQL can open more tables without the need to close and reopen tables frequently, which can be beneficial during operations like \"optimize table\" that may access many tables.\n\n7. **innodb_log_buffer_size** - This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger size can reduce disk I/O by allowing InnoDB to write larger amounts of log data in a single write.\n\nGiven your scenario, the parameters that might be most relevant to adjust are:\n- **tmp_table_size**\n- **max_heap_table_size**\n- **sort_buffer_size**\n- **innodb_buffer_pool_size**\n- **table_open_cache**\n\nThese adjustments can help manage memory usage spikes during intensive database operations like table optimization in a MySQL Docker container."}
