{"res": "Based on the error message you received and the details provided about the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` SQL mode, the recommended parameter to address your issue is:\n\n['sql_mode']\n\nThis parameter can be adjusted to disable the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` mode, which is causing the error due to strict GROUP BY enforcement in MySQL. By modifying this mode, you can execute your query without needing to include every column in the GROUP BY clause that is present in the SELECT list, unless they are functionally dependent on the GROUP BY columns."}
