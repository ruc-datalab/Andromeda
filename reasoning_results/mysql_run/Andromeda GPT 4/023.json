{"res": "Based on the description of your issue with garbled or incorrect characters in MySQL query results, it appears that the problem is indeed related to character encoding settings. The parameters that are most likely to influence this behavior include settings that control the character set and collation at various levels of the database environment. These settings ensure that the data is stored, retrieved, and displayed correctly in the specified character encoding.\n\nHere are the recommended parameters to check and potentially adjust to resolve the issue with character encoding in your MySQL database:\n\n1. `character_set_client`: This parameter sets the character set for the client. It should match the encoding expected by the client application to interpret the bytes received from the server correctly.\n\n2. `character_set_connection`: This parameter sets the character set for the connection. It affects the encoding of queries sent to the server and results returned to the client.\n\n3. `character_set_database`: This parameter sets the default character set for the database. It is important that this matches the character set in which the data is actually stored in the database.\n\n4. `character_set_results`: This parameter sets the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. This should match the character set expected by the client application.\n\n5. `character_set_server`: This parameter sets the default server\u2019s character set. It is used when a new database is created unless specified otherwise.\n\n6. `collation_connection`: This parameter sets the collation for the connection, which affects how string comparison is done. It should be compatible with the `character_set_connection`.\n\nGiven your specific issue with non-ASCII characters appearing as strange symbols, you should ensure that these parameters are set to support UTF-8 or a similar Unicode character set that includes support for the characters you are working with (e.g., `utf8mb4` for full Unicode support including emojis and certain Chinese characters).\n\nHere is the list of parameters you should review and adjust as necessary:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_database', 'character_set_results', 'character_set_server', 'collation_connection']\n```"}
