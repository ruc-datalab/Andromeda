{"res": "The issue you're encountering is not related to database parameters but rather to the SQL query logic itself. In your table, the `id` column is defined as an `AUTO_INCREMENT` primary key, which means it will automatically be assigned a unique, non-null value when a new record is inserted. Therefore, querying for `id IS NULL` will not return any results because `id` cannot be `null` for any record.\n\nTo address the issue, you should modify your SQL query to correctly reflect the logic you want to implement. If you are looking to fetch all records or specific records based on different criteria, you should adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly.\n\nSince the problem is not related to database configuration parameters but rather to the SQL query used, there are no specific MySQL parameters to recommend for altering the behavior of your query. If you need to adjust performance or behavior, you might consider parameters related to indexing, query optimization, or server performance, but these do not directly address the issue described.\n\nHere is a list of common MySQL performance-related parameters, although they are not directly needed for the issue at hand:\n```json\n[\"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"max_connections\", \"query_cache_size\", \"table_open_cache\", \"thread_cache_size\"]\n```"}
