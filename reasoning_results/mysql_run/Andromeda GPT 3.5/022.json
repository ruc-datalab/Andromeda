{"res": "Based on the provided information and user questions, the following parameters are recommended:\n\nRecommended Parameters:\n['ft_boolean_syntax', 'sql_mode', 'collation_connection', 'character_set_client', 'ft_min_word_len', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n\nExplanation:\n1. ft_boolean_syntax: This parameter is related to changing the operators used for boolean full-text searches on MyISAM tables.\n2. sql_mode: Enabling STRICT_ALL_TABLES in the SQL mode can help enforce strict data type checking, which can prevent unexpected behavior like inserting character values into INT fields.\n3. collation_connection: Setting the correct collation for the connection can ensure that string comparisons are done correctly.\n4. character_set_client, character_set_connection, character_set_results: These parameters are related to character set settings, which can affect how string comparisons and searches are performed.\n5. ft_min_word_len: This parameter can affect the minimum word length required for full-text searches, which may impact the search results.\n\nBy considering and adjusting these parameters based on the specific requirements and issues encountered in the user questions, you may be able to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the full-text search feature in MySQL."}
