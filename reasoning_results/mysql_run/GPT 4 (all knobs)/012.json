{"res": "The error you're encountering is due to incorrect SQL syntax and not something that can be resolved by modifying database parameters. The correct syntax for counting all rows in a table is `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM grades;` without any spaces between `COUNT` and `(*)`. There is no database parameter that allows the incorrect syntax `SELECT COUNT (*) FROM grades;` to execute successfully. Therefore, no parameters can be adjusted to allow the incorrect syntax to work. The solution is to use the correct SQL syntax."}
