    "res": "Based on the scenario described where a MySQL Docker container's memory usage increases significantly during an \"optimize table\" operation and considering the database structure (10 small tables and one large table with 10 million rows and an index on every column), the following parameters are likely relevant:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. Increasing this size can help accommodate the large table and its indices during operations like \"optimize table\".\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: This parameter specifies the size of each log file in a log group. A larger log file size might be needed to handle the volume of data generated during intensive operations on large tables.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This parameter sets the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger log buffer allows more data to be held in memory before being written to disk, which can be beneficial during large transactions or optimizations.\n\n4. **innodb_sort_buffer_size**: During the \"optimize table\" operation, sorting may be required, especially if the table structure involves reordering of index data. This parameter adjusts the size of the buffer used for index creation and other sorts.\n\n5. **innodb_io_capacity**: This parameter configures the I/O capacity of the system, which can affect how InnoDB performs file reads and writes during heavy I/O operations like table optimization.\n\n6. **max_heap_table_size**: This parameter sets the maximum size to which user-created MEMORY tables are allowed to grow. The value of this parameter can influence memory usage during operations that temporarily create in-memory tables.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted to optimize the performance and memory usage of MySQL running in a Docker container, especially when dealing with large tables and intensive operations like \"optimize table\".\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```"
