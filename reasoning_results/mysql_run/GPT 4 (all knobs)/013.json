{"res": "To optimize the performance of queries involving a `GROUP BY` clause on a MySQL table using the InnoDB storage engine, you can consider adjusting the following parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter allows more data to be held in memory, reducing disk I/O for large datasets.\n2. **innodb_sort_buffer_size**: This parameter can be increased to provide more memory for sorting operations, which are common in `GROUP BY` queries.\n3. **sort_buffer_size**: This is a session-level parameter that can be increased to allocate more memory for sorting during the execution of a query.\n4. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: Increasing this can improve the efficiency of reading rows that are sorted by the order, which is beneficial for `GROUP BY` operations.\n5. **innodb_io_capacity**: Adjusting this parameter can help optimize the I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform, which can be beneficial if the query involves a lot of data reading from disk.\n\nHere is the list in the required format:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'innodb_sort_buffer_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_rnd_buffer_size', 'innodb_io_capacity']\n```"}
