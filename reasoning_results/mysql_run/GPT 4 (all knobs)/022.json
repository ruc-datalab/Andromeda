{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the full-text search in MySQL not returning the expected results when searching for phrases like 'the cat' is likely due to the default behavior of the full-text search engine regarding stopwords and minimum word length. In MySQL, certain common words (known as stopwords) are omitted from the full-text index because they occur frequently in language and typically do not contribute to the relevance of a search. Additionally, there is a default minimum word length for words included in the full-text index.\n\n1. **ft_min_word_len**: This parameter defines the minimum length of words that are included in the full-text index. By default, this value is set to 4, which means that words with fewer than four characters are ignored during indexing. Since 'the' has only three letters, it would not be indexed.\n\n2. **ft_stopword_file**: This parameter points to the file that contains the list of stopwords used by the full-text search. If 'the' is included in this list, it will not be indexed or searched in the full-text queries.\n\nTo address the issue, you can consider the following adjustments:\n\n- **Reduce the `ft_min_word_len`** to include shorter words in the index. For example, setting it to 3 will include the word 'the'.\n- **Modify the `ft_stopword_file`** to remove 'the' from the stopwords list, or use an empty stopword file to index all words, including typical stopwords.\n\nHere is the list of parameters you might consider adjusting:\n\n```json\n['ft_min_word_len', 'ft_stopword_file']\n```"}
