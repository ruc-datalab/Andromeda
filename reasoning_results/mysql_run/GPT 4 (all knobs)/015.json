{"res": "The issue you're encountering is related to the SQL query you're using. In your query, you're trying to select rows from the table `test1` where `id` is `null`. However, since `id` is a primary key and automatically increments, it cannot be `null`. Therefore, the query should not return any rows, but your description suggests it does return a row incorrectly.\n\nThis behavior is unusual and might suggest an issue with how the database is handling `NULL` checks or an anomaly in data integrity. However, from a database configuration perspective, there are no specific parameters that directly control this behavior as it's more related to SQL query syntax and database design.\n\nIf you're looking to ensure the integrity and behavior of auto-increment primary keys and NULL handling, you might want to review the following parameters to ensure they are set correctly, although they typically wouldn't cause the issue you're describing unless there's a very unusual configuration or a bug:\n\n1. `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` - Ensures that the behavior of auto-increment locking is appropriate for your replication setup or specific use case.\n2. `sql_mode` - Includes settings that can change the behavior of SQL queries, such as handling of invalid data or strict SQL mode which can prevent incorrect data from being inserted.\n\nHowever, these parameters are unlikely to resolve the issue of a query returning rows when it should return none based on a `NULL` check against a primary key. It's recommended to:\n\n- Double-check the query and table schema.\n- Ensure there is no data corruption or unexpected behavior at the application layer or due to replication setups.\n- Verify that the MySQL version you are using does not have a known bug related to this behavior.\n\nFor the purpose of the task and based on the description, the output list of parameters that might be relevant (though not directly solving the described issue) would be:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\", \"sql_mode\"]\n```"}
