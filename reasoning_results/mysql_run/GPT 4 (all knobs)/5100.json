{"res": "To clear out the profile listing in MySQL after enabling profiling and running queries, you can use the following command:\n\n```sql\nSET profiling_history_size = 0;\n```\n\nThis command sets the number of query profiles that will be stored in the profiling queue to zero, effectively clearing out existing profiles. If you want to continue profiling after clearing the data, you should set the `profiling_history_size` back to a positive number.\n\nThe relevant parameter from the list provided is:\n\n```json\n[\"profiling_history_size\"]\n```"}
