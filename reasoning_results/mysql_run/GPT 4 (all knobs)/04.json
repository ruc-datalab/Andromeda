{"res": "To address the issue of high throughput and strain on server resources due to large data retrieval from select * queries, you can adjust the following MySQL server parameters to optimize performance:\n\n1. **max_allowed_packet** - Increase this value if you are hitting limits with large packets, which can happen with big result sets.\n2. **read_buffer_size** - Adjust this to optimize the sequential read operations.\n3. **read_rnd_buffer_size** - This parameter helps with reads that are required after sorting, which can be intensive with large result sets.\n4. **sort_buffer_size** - Increasing this can help with performance when sorting large numbers of rows, which is common in select * queries.\n5. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables, which are used for query processing. Adjusting these can help manage the memory usage when dealing with large datasets.\n6. **query_cache_size** (if using a version of MySQL that still supports the query cache) - Adjusting the query cache size can help reduce the load by caching the result set of frequent queries. However, note that in many cases, especially with highly dynamic tables, the query cache might reduce performance.\n7. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - Ensuring this is adequately sized to hold your working dataset can significantly improve read performance.\n8. **sql_select_limit** - This can be set globally or session-wise to limit the number of rows returned by default for all SELECT queries, which can implicitly reduce the load caused by large result sets.\n\nHere's the list in the required format:\n\n```json\n[\"max_allowed_packet\", \"read_buffer_size\", \"read_rnd_buffer_size\", \"sort_buffer_size\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\", \"query_cache_size\", \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"sql_select_limit\"]\n```"}
