{"res": "The behavior you're describing regarding the precedence of operators in MySQL, specifically the `NOT` operator having lower precedence than comparison operators like `<`, is defined by the SQL standard and MySQL's implementation. Unfortunately, there is no MySQL server system variable or configuration that allows you to change the precedence of operators directly. The precedence is fixed and built into the SQL language parser in MySQL.\n\nTo achieve the desired effect in your queries, you should use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations. For example, you can write your query as `SELECT NOT (1 < -1);` to ensure that the comparison `1 < -1` is evaluated before the `NOT` operator.\n\nSince there is no direct parameter to adjust this behavior, the output list of parameters would be empty:\n\n```json\n[]\n```"}
