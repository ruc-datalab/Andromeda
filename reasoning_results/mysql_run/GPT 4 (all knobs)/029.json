{"res": "The error you're encountering when trying to use the `CONVERT_TZ()` function in MySQL typically occurs because the time zone information isn't populated in the MySQL server. MySQL relies on time zone tables in the database to perform the conversion. If these tables are not populated, the `CONVERT_TZ()` function will not work as expected.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the MySQL time zone tables are populated. You can do this by loading the time zone information into MySQL. Here\u2019s how you can fix this:\n\n1. **Populate the Time Zone Tables**: You need to load the time zone data into MySQL's time zone tables (`time_zone`, `time_zone_transition`, etc.) if they aren't already populated. This is typically done using the `mysql_tzinfo_to_sql` utility and reloading the data into the MySQL database.\n\n2. **Check the `time_zone` Parameter**: Ensure that the MySQL server\u2019s `time_zone` parameter is set correctly. This might not directly impact the `CONVERT_TZ()` function but is good practice to ensure the server operates in the correct time zone.\n\nHere are the parameters related to time zone configuration in MySQL:\n\n```json\n['time_zone']\n```\n\nTo populate the time zone tables, you can use the following steps on the server where MySQL is installed:\n\n1. **Load Time Zone Data**:\n   ```bash\n   mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root -p mysql\n   ```\n   This command reads the system time zone files and loads them into the MySQL database. You will need to enter the MySQL root password.\n\n2. **Verify Time Zone Table Population**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM mysql.time_zone_name;\n   ```\n   Run this SQL query to check if the time zone names are populated.\n\nBy ensuring the time zone tables are populated and setting the appropriate server time zone, the `CONVERT_TZ()` function should work correctly."}
