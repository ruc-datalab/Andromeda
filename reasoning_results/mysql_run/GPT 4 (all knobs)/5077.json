    "res": "It appears that you are facing issues with the decryption of data in your SQL queries, which might not be directly related to database parameters but rather to the SQL syntax or the method used for encryption and decryption. However, if you are looking for database parameters that could potentially influence the behavior of encryption functions or related settings, here are a few that might be relevant, although they are generally more about the server's configuration rather than direct decryption:\n\n1. `block_encryption_mode` - This parameter sets the block encryption mode used by the AES encryption functions. It might be relevant if the mode used during encryption and decryption needs to be explicitly set or adjusted.\n\n2. `innodb_encrypt_tables` - If you are using InnoDB tables and want to ensure that the tables are encrypted, this parameter can be set. It's not directly related to the function-based encryption/decryption of specific columns but affects the table-level encryption.\n\n3. `innodb_encryption_threads` - This parameter controls the number of threads performing background encryption and decryption on InnoDB tablespaces. Again, this is more about tablespace encryption rather than column-specific encryption.\n\n4. `ssl_ca`, `ssl_cert`, `ssl_key` - These parameters are related to the SSL/TLS configuration for encrypted connections to the MySQL server. They are not directly used for column encryption but are crucial for securing connections.\n\n5. `innodb_encryption_rotate_key_age` - Controls the age after which an encryption key is rotated in InnoDB. This parameter is part of the broader encryption key management in InnoDB.\n\n6. `innodb_encryption_rotation_iops` - This parameter limits the I/O operations per second (IOPS) allowed for background encryption key rotation, affecting performance but not directly related to your issue.\n\nGiven your scenario, it's important to ensure that the encryption and decryption functions are correctly used in your SQL queries and that the key and initialization vector (IV) are correctly handled. The issues you are experiencing might be due to incorrect binary data handling or mismatches in the encryption and decryption processes rather than database configuration parameters. Make sure that the data types and the way binary data (like encrypted data) is handled in your queries are correct. Also, verify that the same encryption mode and settings are used consistently across your encryption and decryption logic."
