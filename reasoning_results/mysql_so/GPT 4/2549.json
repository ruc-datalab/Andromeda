{"res": "To generate a list from the levels in the `vCategoryTree` table into a row-based result tree as described, you can use a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in MySQL. This will allow you to traverse the hierarchical data stored in the table. Since MySQL 8.0 supports recursive CTEs, this approach will be effective for your needs.\n\nHere are the recommended SQL parameters and query structure to achieve the desired output:\n\n1. **Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Use a CTE to recursively query the hierarchical data.\n2. **ORDER BY Clause**: To ensure the data is listed in the hierarchical order as per your requirement.\n3. **COALESCE Function**: To handle NULL values in the hierarchy and ensure smooth recursion.\n\nHere is a conceptual SQL query using these parameters:\n\n```sql\nWITH RECURSIVE CategoryPath AS (\n    SELECT level1 AS category, level2, level3, level4, level5\n    FROM vCategoryTree\n    WHERE level1 IS NOT NULL\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT c.level1, c.level2, c.level3, c.level4, c.level5\n    FROM vCategoryTree c\n    INNER JOIN CategoryPath cp ON c.level1 = cp.level2 OR c.level2 = cp.level3 OR c.level3 = cp.level4 OR c.level4 = cp.level5\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(level5, level4, level3, level2, level1) AS category\nFROM CategoryPath\nORDER BY category;\n```\n\nThis query starts from the first level and recursively joins the table with itself to traverse down the hierarchy. The `COALESCE` function is used to select the first non-null level from the bottom up, ensuring that each category is listed correctly. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that the categories are listed in the correct order.\n\nPlease adjust the query based on your specific version of MySQL and test it to ensure it meets the exact output format and order you require."}
