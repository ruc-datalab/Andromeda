{"res": "Based on the description and the issues you are facing with your Django model and custom field for storing geolocation data, here are some recommended parameters and changes to improve your implementation:\n\n1. **Use PostgreSQL's native geographic data types**: Instead of storing latitude and longitude as a string, consider using PostgreSQL's native geographic data types. This would involve changing your database schema to use `Point` from the `PostGIS` extension, which is specifically designed for handling geographic information.\n\n2. **Install and configure PostGIS**: If not already done, install the PostGIS extension in your PostgreSQL database. This extension adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL.\n\n3. **Modify the Django model to use `PointField`**: Change your Django model to use Django's built-in `PointField` which integrates with PostGIS's geographic types. This change simplifies handling and querying of geographic data.\n\n4. **Ensure proper field serialization**: If you still prefer to use a custom string format for any reason (e.g., integration with other systems that require this format), ensure that your `get_prep_value` and `from_db_value` methods correctly handle serialization and deserialization of the data. The `get_prep_value` should correctly format the latitude and longitude into a string, and `from_db_value` should correctly parse these values back into a Python object.\n\n5. **Validate input data rigorously**: Enhance the validation in your custom field to handle various edge cases and ensure that the input data is always in the expected format. This includes checking for non-numeric values, values out of the expected range for latitude and longitude, and incorrect formatting.\n\n6. **Optimize database indexing for geolocation queries**: If you are querying the geolocation data frequently, consider adding indexes on the geographic data fields. In the case of using PostGIS, you can use spatial indexes to improve the performance of spatial queries.\n\n7. **Review and handle exceptions**: Ensure that your custom field properly handles exceptions, providing clear error messages for debugging and user feedback. This includes handling exceptions in `parse_location` and other methods where data parsing and manipulation occur.\n\n8. **Use Django's `ArrayField` appropriately**: If you decide to store multiple geolocations for a single model instance and wish to continue using `ArrayField`, ensure that it is used correctly with a compatible base field. When using `PointField` with `ArrayField`, make sure that the array operations are supported for the geographic data types in PostgreSQL.\n\nBy implementing these parameters and changes, you should be able to handle geolocation data more effectively in your Django application with PostgreSQL."}
