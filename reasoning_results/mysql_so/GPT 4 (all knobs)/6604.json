{"res": "Based on the details provided about the high memory utilization issue on your RDS MySQL server, several parameters can be adjusted to potentially alleviate the problem. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is already set quite high at 144 GB, which is appropriate given your total memory, but ensure it's not set too high as to leave too little memory for other processes and the OS.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_instances**: Increasing the number of buffer pool instances can help manage memory more efficiently, especially with such a large buffer pool size. Consider setting this to a higher value, such as 8 or 16, to improve concurrency and reduce contention within the buffer pool.\n\n3. **max_connections**: The current setting (20484) seems excessively high, which can lead to high memory consumption as each connection requires memory for connection buffers and other structures. Consider reducing this to a more reasonable number based on your application's concurrency requirements.\n\n4. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this parameter to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. A higher value can help manage server threads more efficiently, reducing memory overhead.\n\n5. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This parameter is set to 64 MB, which might be low depending on your workload. Increasing it can reduce disk I/O for transaction logs but will use more memory.\n\n6. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These are set to 4096 MB, which is quite large and can lead to high memory usage if many temporary tables are being created in memory. Consider lowering these values if your workload does not require such large temporary tables.\n\n7. **query_cache_size**: This is set to 64 MB. If the query cache is not effectively utilized, consider disabling it by setting `query_cache_type` to 0 and `query_cache_size` to 0, as the query cache can have overheads and can contribute to contention.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size**, **read_buffer_size**, **read_rnd_buffer_size**, and **join_buffer_size**: These are set relatively low, but be cautious about increasing them significantly as they are allocated per connection.\n\n9. **innodb_page_cleaners**: This is set to 1. Increasing this number can help in environments with heavy write activity, as it will allow more threads to clean modified pages in the buffer pool.\n\n10. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings are not listed but are important for controlling I/O throughput for background tasks. Adjusting these might help balance I/O and memory usage.\n\nHere's the list of parameters to consider adjusting based on your configuration and issues:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_instances\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_page_cleaners\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be tested in a controlled environment before being applied to production to ensure they have the desired effect without negative impacts."}
