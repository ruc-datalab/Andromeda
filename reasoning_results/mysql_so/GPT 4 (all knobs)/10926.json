{"res": "To optimize the MySQL server configuration for handling large SQL file imports like your Wikipedia database copy, you can adjust several parameters to improve performance. Given your server's specifications (2GB RAM) and the nature of the workload (large insert operations), here are some recommended parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: You've already set this to 1GB, which is half of your total RAM. This is a good setting given your hardware constraints.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: Increase the size of the log file to handle larger transactions more efficiently. A larger log file size can reduce the need for MySQL to write the log to disk frequently, which can be beneficial during large data imports.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increase this to buffer more log data in memory before writing it to disk. A larger log buffer allows transactions to run without needing to write the log to disk before the transactions commit.\n\n4. **max_allowed_packet**: Increase this to maximize the size of a single query, especially since you're dealing with large insert statements. This setting should be increased if you encounter errors related to packet size.\n\n5. **bulk_insert_buffer_size**: Increase this to allow larger buffers for bulk insert operations, which can improve the performance of inserting large volumes of data.\n\n6. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Set this to 2 if you can tolerate a slight delay in log writing in case of a crash. This setting improves performance because it reduces disk I/O by not flushing the log at every transaction commit.\n\n7. **innodb_doublewrite**: Consider setting this to 0 to disable the doublewrite buffer, which can improve performance but at the risk of potential data loss in the event of a crash during a write operation.\n\n8. **key_buffer_size**: If your tables are MyISAM, increase this to improve index handling. However, for InnoDB, this setting is less relevant.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size** and **read_rnd_buffer_size**: Increase these settings to improve the sequential and random read performance, respectively.\n\n10. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode**: Set this to 2 (interleaved lock mode) to improve the performance of AUTO_INCREMENT handling in a concurrent environment.\n\nHere's the configuration list in the format you requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"bulk_insert_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_doublewrite\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\"\n]\n```\n\nThese settings should help improve the performance of importing large SQL files into your MySQL database. Always ensure to test changes in a development environment before applying them to production. Additionally, consider monitoring the server's performance and adjust the settings as needed based on the observed impact."}
