{"res": "The error message you're encountering is a syntax error in your SQL statement, not directly related to the language settings of your database server. However, the error message is displayed in French, which suggests that the server's language settings might not be correctly set to English. Here are the relevant parameters to check and adjust:\n\n1. **lc_messages** - This parameter controls the language of the error messages. Setting it to 'en_US' should display error messages in English.\n2. **lc_messages_dir** - This parameter specifies the directory where the error message files are located. Ensure this is correctly pointing to the directory containing the English language files.\n\nAdditionally, the syntax error in your SQL statement is due to incorrect table naming and possibly the incorrect use of data types. Here's a corrected version of your SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `tableA` (\n  `A` TIMESTAMP(1) PRIMARY KEY,\n  `B` TIMESTAMP(1),\n  `C` VARCHAR(100),\n  `D` VARCHAR(25)\n);\n```\n\nNote the following corrections:\n- Table and column names are enclosed in backticks (`) to avoid syntax issues.\n- `PRIMARY KEY` is correctly specified for column `A`.\n\nHere's the list of parameters you might want to adjust to resolve the language issue:\n\n```json\n[\"lc_messages\", \"lc_messages_dir\"]\n```"}
