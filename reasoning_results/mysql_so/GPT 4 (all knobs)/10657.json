{"res": "Based on the detailed information provided, including the system's performance metrics and MySQL configuration, it appears that the primary bottleneck is related to I/O wait times and CPU usage. Here are some MySQL parameters that could potentially help optimize the performance for your specific workload, especially considering the high I/O wait and CPU usage:\n\n1. **innodb_io_capacity**: This parameter specifies the number of I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform. Since your system seems to be I/O bound, increasing this value might help InnoDB better utilize the I/O subsystem.\n\n2. **innodb_io_capacity_max**: This is the upper limit for the number of I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform. It should be set higher than `innodb_io_capacity`.\n\n3. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of threads that InnoDB uses to perform read and write I/O operations. Increasing these values can help in environments with high I/O.\n\n4. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter can be used to limit the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently. Adjusting this might help manage CPU usage more effectively.\n\n5. **innodb_flush_neighbors**: Setting this to 0 on SSDs can reduce the I/O overhead because SSDs do not need to perform sequential read-ahead as HDDs do.\n\n6. **innodb_buffer_pool_instances**: Increasing the number of buffer pool instances can help reduce contention within the buffer pool, especially on systems with many cores and a large buffer pool.\n\n7. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing the log buffer size can reduce disk I/O by holding more data in memory before flushing it to the log file.\n\n8. **innodb_flush_log_at_timeout**: Adjusting this value can control how often InnoDB flushes the log to disk, impacting I/O behavior.\n\n9. **thread_cache_size**: Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads, which can be beneficial in environments with a high number of connections and queries.\n\n10. **max_connections**: Ensure this is set to a reasonable number that matches your hardware capabilities and workload requirements to prevent excessive CPU usage due to too many concurrent connections.\n\n11. **table_open_cache** and **table_open_cache_instances**: Adjusting these parameters can help reduce the overhead of opening and closing tables, which can be beneficial in environments with a large number of tables being accessed.\n\nGiven the updates and the performance metrics shared, here is a recommended list of parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_flush_neighbors\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_instances\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_timeout\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"table_open_cache_instances\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be made cautiously, monitoring the system's response to each change to ensure that performance is moving in the desired direction."}
