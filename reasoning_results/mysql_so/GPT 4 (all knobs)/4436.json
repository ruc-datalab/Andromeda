{"res": "To address the timeout error you're experiencing with your MySQL query involving regular expressions, you can adjust the following parameters in your MySQL configuration:\n\n1. **`net_read_timeout`**: This parameter sets the number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before aborting the read. If your regular expression operations are causing delays, increasing this might help.\n\n2. **`net_write_timeout`**: Similar to `net_read_timeout`, this parameter sets the timeout for writing to the connection. Increasing this value can prevent timeouts during long operations that need to send data back to the client.\n\n3. **`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`**: If your query is waiting for row locks and timing out, increasing this value can help. However, this is less likely the issue here since your query seems to be read-heavy.\n\n4. **`wait_timeout`**: This is the number of seconds the server waits for activity on a non-interactive connection before closing it. If your script connects to the database but then spends a lot of time processing before performing the query, this could be relevant.\n\n5. **`interactive_timeout`**: This is similar to `wait_timeout`, but for interactive sessions. If you're running queries manually for testing, this might be relevant.\n\n6. **`max_allowed_packet`**: If your query generates large results or large intermediate strings, increasing this value allows for larger packet sizes between the server and client.\n\nGiven the nature of your query and the error message, the most relevant parameters to adjust would likely be `net_read_timeout` and `net_write_timeout`, as these directly impact how long the server waits before timing out on read and write operations, which are heavily utilized during complex REGEXP operations.\n\nHere's the output list of these parameters:\n\n```json\n['net_read_timeout', 'net_write_timeout', 'innodb_lock_wait_timeout', 'wait_timeout', 'interactive_timeout', 'max_allowed_packet']\n```"}
