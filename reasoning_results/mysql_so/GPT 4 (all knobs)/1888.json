{"res": "To specifically address the suppression of warning messages without affecting error or note messages in MySQL, you can adjust the `sql_notes` system variable.

This is a more targeted approach than using `max_error_count`, which affects all types of messages.\n\nHere is the recommended parameter based on your requirement:\n\n```json\n['sql_notes']\n```"}
