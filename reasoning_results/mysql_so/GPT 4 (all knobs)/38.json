{"res": "To address the requirement of modifying an event to check every table in a database for a condition without repeating code for each table, you would typically look into dynamic SQL execution within stored procedures or events. However, since the question specifically asks for database parameters that could be relevant to this scenario, we need to focus on parameters that influence event scheduling, execution, and possibly logging for debugging purposes.\n\nHere are some relevant MySQL parameters that could be considered to ensure the event scheduler is properly configured and optimized for handling such dynamic SQL tasks:\n\n1. **event_scheduler**: This parameter enables or disables the event scheduler. It must be enabled to ensure that your event runs as expected.\n\n2. **max_allowed_packet**: This parameter might need to be adjusted if the dynamic SQL statement generated becomes large, especially when dealing with many tables.\n\n3. **log_bin_trust_function_creators**: If binary logging is enabled and you are creating stored procedures or functions, setting this parameter to `1` can be necessary to avoid issues with function creation without explicit determinism information.\n\n4. **general_log**: Enabling this parameter can help in debugging by logging all queries to the general query log, including those executed by scheduled events.\n\n5. **general_log_file**: Specifies the file to which the general log records are written, useful for reviewing the executed queries by the event.\n\n6. **log_error**: Specifies the file to which errors encountered during the execution of MySQL are logged, which can be useful for debugging issues in event execution.\n\nThese parameters focus on ensuring the event scheduler is active and properly configured, and that adequate logging is available for monitoring and debugging the event's operation. Adjusting these settings can help manage and troubleshoot the dynamic SQL execution within the event.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"event_scheduler\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"log_bin_trust_function_creators\",\n    \"general_log\",\n    \"general_log_file\",\n    \"log_error\"\n]\n```"}
