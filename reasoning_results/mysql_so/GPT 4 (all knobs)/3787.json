{"res": "Based on the scenario described where the console freezes during a MySQL import of a large SQL file, it seems the issue might be related to system or MySQL configuration settings that affect how large data imports are handled. Here are some MySQL parameters that could potentially influence this behavior:\n\n1. `innodb_buffer_pool_size` - This parameter determines the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. If this is too low, it could slow down the import process as the system struggles to cache the data efficiently.\n\n2. `max_allowed_packet` - This setting controls the maximum packet size for network communication. If the SQL file contains very large queries, increasing this value might help.\n\n3. `innodb_log_file_size` - This is the size of each log file in a log group. Larger transactions require larger log files, so increasing this might help if the transactions in the import are large.\n\n4. `innodb_log_buffer_size` - This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger size could reduce disk I/O by allowing more data to be stored in memory before being flushed to disk.\n\n5. `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` - This setting controls the balance between strict ACID compliance and higher performance. Setting it to 2 can improve performance by writing the log to the file system once per second and to the log file at each commit.\n\n6. `innodb_write_io_threads` - Increasing the number of I/O threads may improve the performance of I/O operations, particularly for large data loads.\n\n7. `innodb_read_io_threads` - Similar to write I/O threads, increasing read I/O threads can enhance the read performance during data import operations.\n\n8. `net_buffer_length` - This parameter sets the buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. Adjusting this might help with handling large imports.\n\n9. `bulk_insert_buffer_size` - This setting allocates a memory buffer for bulk insert operations like those used during large data imports. Increasing it can speed up such operations.\n\n10. `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` - Setting this to a more permissive lock mode can improve the performance of inserting data into tables with auto-increment primary keys.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted to potentially resolve issues related to system performance during large data imports, such as the one described. However, it's important to test changes in a development environment before applying them in production to ensure they do not negatively affect other database operations."}
