{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the `Auto_increment` field in the `SHOW TABLE STATUS` output is returning `NULL` even after inserting rows into a table with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a transient issue with how MySQL updates and displays this value. The `Auto_increment` value should reflect the next value that will be used for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, and it should update after rows are inserted.\n\nHowever, if the value is not updating immediately but appears correct after some time, it could be related to how MySQL internally caches and updates table metadata. This behavior might not be directly controllable by a specific MySQL parameter but could be influenced by factors such as table metadata locking, server load, or caching mechanisms.\n\nHere are some parameters that could potentially influence the behavior, although they might not directly resolve the issue described:\n\n1. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode** - This parameter determines the lock mode used for generating auto-increment values. Different modes can affect concurrency and behavior in replication setups. It's worth checking its setting, although it's unlikely to be the cause of the issue.\n\n2. **autocommit** - You've already checked this, and it's set to 'ON'. This setting should ensure that each insert statement is committed immediately, making the `Auto_increment` value update accordingly.\n\n3. **innodb_table_stats_on_metadata** - When enabled, this can cause InnoDB to update table statistics (including index statistics) when metadata statements like `SHOW TABLE STATUS` are run. Disabling it might reduce the frequency of statistics updates, but it could also affect the visibility of `Auto_increment` updates.\n\n4. **table_open_cache** - This parameter determines how many table metadata instances can be stored in the cache. If this cache is full, it might delay metadata updates from being visible.\n\n5. **innodb_stats_on_metadata** - Similar to `innodb_table_stats_on_metadata`, this controls whether InnoDB updates its table and index statistics when accessing metadata. Disabling it might improve performance on metadata-heavy workloads but could also impact the visibility of metadata changes.\n\nGiven the parameters and the behavior described, it seems more likely that the issue is related to a transient state or delay in the MySQL server's internal handling of metadata updates rather than a misconfiguration. If the problem persists or significantly impacts usage, consider consulting MySQL support or further investigating any related bugs or behaviors specific to the MySQL version in use (8.0.12 as mentioned).\n\nOutputting the list of potentially relevant parameters based on the description:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\", \"autocommit\", \"innodb_table_stats_on_metadata\", \"table_open_cache\", \"innodb_stats_on_metadata\"]\n```"}
