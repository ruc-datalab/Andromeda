{"res": "Based on the details provided and the issues you are encountering with the import of a large MySQL dump into a MariaDB server, it seems the problem might be related to the handling of large packets and possibly the SQL mode settings that could affect syntax interpretation. Here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your MariaDB configuration to potentially resolve these issues:\n\n1. **max_allowed_packet** - This parameter sets the maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string. The errors you're encountering during large insert operations might be due to the packet size exceeding the default limit.\n\n2. **sql_mode** - MariaDB and MySQL can have different SQL modes set by default, which can affect how SQL syntax is interpreted. Ensuring compatibility in SQL modes can help avoid syntax errors during imports.\n\n3. **innodb_log_file_size** - This is the size of the log file in the InnoDB recovery log group. A larger log file size can handle larger transactions, which is critical during imports of large databases.\n\n4. **innodb_strict_mode** - Enabling this can help catch certain errors which might otherwise lead to warnings. This could potentially help in identifying issues during the import process.\n\n5. **log_error_verbosity** - This parameter controls the verbosity of the error log. Increasing it can provide more detailed error information, which might be useful for debugging the import errors.\n\n6. **bulk_insert_buffer_size** - This affects the size of the buffer that is used for bulk insert operations, potentially improving the performance and manageability of large insert queries.\n\nGiven your scenario, here is the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"sql_mode\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_strict_mode\",\n    \"log_error_verbosity\",\n    \"bulk_insert_buffer_size\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters might help mitigate the issues you're facing with the import process. Make sure to test these changes in a development environment before applying them in production."}
