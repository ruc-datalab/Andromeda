{"res": "To clear out the profile listing in MySQL after profiling has been enabled and used, you can reset the profiling history size to zero. This effectively clears the existing profile data. The parameter to adjust is `profiling_history_size`. Here's how you can set it:\n\n```sql\nSET profiling_history_size = 0;\n```\n\nThis command sets the number of query profiles that are stored in the history to zero, clearing existing profiles. If you want to start profiling again and keep a certain number of profiles, you can reset this value to a number greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, the relevant parameter from the list provided is:\n\n```json\n[\"profiling_history_size\"]\n```"}
