{"res": "The error you're encountering, \"Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails,\" indicates that the row you are trying to delete in the `inventory` table is being referenced by another table through a foreign key constraint. This is a common issue in relational databases where referential integrity is enforced to prevent orphan records in the child table.\n\nTo address this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Temporarily Disable Foreign Key Checks**: This allows you to bypass the foreign key constraint check for the duration of your session. This is useful for operations like bulk deletes or imports where you manage the order of operations to maintain integrity yourself.\n\n2. **Modify the Foreign Key Constraint**: If the foreign key constraint is set to `RESTRICT` or `NO ACTION`, you could change it to `SET NULL` or `CASCADE`, depending on the business logic. `SET NULL` will set the foreign key in the child table to NULL when the parent row is deleted, while `CASCADE` will delete the child rows when the parent row is deleted.\n\n3. **Check Dependent Rows**: Before deleting, check if there are any dependent rows in the child tables. If there are, you might need to delete or update these rows to not reference the row you intend to delete.\n\nGiven the context of your question, here are the relevant MySQL parameters that could be considered, although they are more about configuring the server behavior rather than directly solving the issue through a single setting:\n\n- `foreign_key_checks`: This parameter can be set to `0` to disable the foreign key constraint check temporarily. After your operations, you should set it back to `1` to re-enable the checks.\n\n- `innodb_safe_truncate`: Although not directly related to deletion, it affects how table truncation behaves with respect to foreign key constraints.\n\nHere is the output list of relevant parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"foreign_key_checks\", \"innodb_safe_truncate\"]\n```"}
