{"res": "To address the issue of creating a user with a password that does not meet the default length requirements in MySQL, you can adjust the password validation policy settings. Since MySQL 5.7 enforces a minimum password length of 8 characters by default, you need to modify the password validation plugin's settings to allow shorter passwords.\n\nHere are the relevant parameters you can adjust:\n\n1. `validate_password_length` - This parameter sets the minimum required length for passwords. By default, it is set to 8. You can reduce this value to allow shorter passwords.\n2. `validate_password_policy` - This parameter determines the strength of the password policy (from low to strong). Reducing the policy level may also reduce other constraints on password complexity.\n\nTo allow a six-character password, you would set these parameters as follows:\n\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL validate_password_length = 6;\nSET GLOBAL validate_password_policy = LOW;\n```\n\nAfter adjusting these settings, you should be able to create a user with a six-character password. Here is the list of parameters you would adjust:\n\n```json\n['validate_password_length', 'validate_password_policy']\n```"}
