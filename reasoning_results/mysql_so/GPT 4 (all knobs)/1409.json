{"res": "To address the I/O performance issues described in your scenario, several MySQL configuration parameters can be adjusted to optimize disk I/O operations, especially considering the hardware upgrade and the specific workload characteristics you mentioned. Here are some recommended parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter allows more data to be held in memory, reducing disk I/O. Given the memory increase in the 4xlarge instance, you can allocate more memory to the buffer pool.\n\n2. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These parameters should be adjusted based on the I/O capabilities of your hardware. The 4xlarge instance will likely have better I/O capabilities, so increasing these values can help in utilizing the disk subsystem more efficiently.\n\n3. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: You mentioned setting flush to disk every second. This parameter is crucial for balancing between ACID compliance and performance. Setting it to 2 might improve performance if durability is less of a concern.\n\n4. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Larger log files and buffers can reduce disk I/O by handling more data in memory before flushing it to disk.\n\n5. **innodb_file_per_table**: Enabling this can help in managing I/O by segregating each table\u2019s data and index into separate files, which is beneficial especially when you have a few tables that are responsible for most of the I/O load.\n\n6. **innodb_write_io_threads** and **innodb_read_io_threads**: Increasing these values can improve I/O throughput by allowing InnoDB to use more threads for read and write I/O operations.\n\n7. **innodb_flush_neighbors**: Setting this to 0 on SSDs (if your EBS volumes are SSD-backed) can reduce unnecessary I/O.\n\n8. **table_open_cache** and **table_open_cache_instances**: Increasing these values can reduce the overhead of opening and closing tables, which is beneficial if you have a large number of tables being accessed.\n\nGiven your questions about hardware upgrade and partitioning:\n\n1. **Upgrading to a 4xlarge instance**: This upgrade will likely provide significant performance improvements due to increased memory, better network performance, and potentially better disk I/O capabilities (assuming EBS optimization and SSDs are used effectively). The parameters like `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `innodb_io_capacity`, and thread settings should be adjusted to leverage the new hardware capabilities.\n\n2. **Partitioning high-load tables**: This can help in distributing the I/O load more evenly and improving access times by isolating partitions on different disks or simply reducing the size of data that needs to be scanned for queries. It's a logical restructuring that complements the physical hardware upgrade.\n\nBased on these considerations, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_flush_neighbors\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"table_open_cache_instances\"\n]\n```"}
