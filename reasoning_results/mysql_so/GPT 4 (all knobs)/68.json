{"res": "To address the issue you're facing with combining the `SET SESSION` and `SELECT` statements into a single command for execution via the MySQL command-line interface, you need to ensure that the statements are properly separated. In MySQL, you can separate multiple statements with a semicolon (`;`). However, when executing commands through the MySQL CLI using the `-e` option, you need to ensure the entire command is properly formatted and enclosed in quotes. \n\nThe error in your command is likely due to incorrect concatenation and formatting of the SQL statements. Here's how you can correct it:\n\n```bash\nmg_=`mysql -u$dbUser -p$dbPass -e \"SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 200000; SELECT CONCAT( 'DROP TABLE ', GROUP_CONCAT(table_name) , ';' ) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'updates_temp' AND table_name LIKE 'mg_%';\" -s`\n```\n\nNotice the addition of a semicolon (`;`) right after setting the `group_concat_max_len` and before the `SELECT` statement. This ensures that the `SET SESSION` statement is executed first, and then the `SELECT` statement is processed.\n\nRegarding the database parameters you asked about, the relevant parameters from your scenario are:\n\n1. `group_concat_max_len` - This parameter is directly used in your command to increase the maximum length of the result of the `GROUP_CONCAT` function, which is crucial for ensuring that the concatenated string of table names does not exceed the default length limit.\n\nHere's the output list format you requested:\n\n```json\n['group_concat_max_len']\n```\n\nThis list includes the parameter that is directly relevant and manipulated in your SQL command to ensure the desired operation of concatenating table names for generating a dynamic SQL drop statement."}
