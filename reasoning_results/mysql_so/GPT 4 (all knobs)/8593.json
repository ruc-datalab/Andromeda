{"res": "Based on the error messages and the scenario described, it appears that there are issues related to binary log and replication event checksums between the MySQL 5.5 master and the MariaDB 10.2.9 slave. The error messages indicate problems with the `binlog_checksum` and the slave's ability to handle these checksums, as well as issues writing to the relay log.\n\nHere are the relevant parameters to consider adjusting to resolve the issues:\n\n1. **`binlog_checksum`** - You've already set this to 'NONE' on the master, which is necessary because MariaDB might not recognize the checksums used by MySQL 5.5.\n\n2. **`slave_sql_verify_checksum`** - You attempted to set this to 0, which is correct. This setting disables the verification of replication event checksums on the slave, which can help avoid conflicts due to version differences in checksum handling.\n\n3. **`log_bin`** - Ensure that binary logging is enabled on the slave if it's required for your replication setup. This isn't directly mentioned in your configuration, but it's important for certain types of replication setups.\n\n4. **`relay_log`** - This parameter specifies the location and name of the relay log files. Sometimes, issues with the relay log can be resolved by adjusting the path or permissions.\n\n5. **`sync_binlog`** - This parameter controls the synchronization of the binary log to disk. You might want to adjust this for performance reasons, especially if you're encountering I/O errors.\n\n6. **`slave_net_timeout`** - Increase this value if network issues are causing timeouts between the master and slave.\n\n7. **`max_allowed_packet`** - Ensure this is sufficiently large to handle the events being replicated. Mismatches in this value between master and slave can cause issues.\n\n8. **`read_only`** - Ensure this is set appropriately on the slave to prevent accidental writes that are not part of the replication process.\n\nGiven the specific error \"Relay log write failure: could not queue event from master,\" you might also want to check the disk space and permissions for the directory where the relay logs are stored to ensure MariaDB can write to that location.\n\nThe recommended parameters to adjust based on your scenario are:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"binlog_checksum\",\n    \"slave_sql_verify_checksum\",\n    \"log_bin\",\n    \"relay_log\",\n    \"sync_binlog\",\n    \"slave_net_timeout\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"read_only\"\n]\n```"}
