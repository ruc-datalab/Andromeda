{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the problem and the provided SQL query performance issues, it seems that the main concern is the initial slow performance of queries after a period of inactivity, which then perform well on subsequent executions. This behavior is typically related to the database's caching mechanism and how data is loaded into memory. Here are some MySQL parameters that could be relevant to address the issues described:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter determines the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. Increasing this size can help keep more data in memory, reducing the need to read from disk, especially for the initial query after a period of inactivity.\n\n2. **query_cache_type**: Although deprecated in later versions, for MySQL 5.6, ensuring that the query cache is enabled (`query_cache_type = ON`) might help if the same queries are executed frequently.\n\n3. **query_cache_size**: If the query cache is used, setting this to a higher value allocates more memory to the query cache, allowing more results to be cached.\n\n4. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing this parameter can reduce disk I/O by caching more log information in memory.\n\n5. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations in InnoDB. Increasing these values can improve I/O throughput.\n\n6. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value raises the number of open tables for all threads, which can help performance if your application accesses many tables.\n\n7. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter increases the number of threads that can be cached for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many threads already there.\n\n8. **innodb_stats_on_metadata**: Setting this to `OFF` can improve performance by preventing InnoDB from updating statistics when metadata statements are executed.\n\n9. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables for subqueries or complex joins might benefit from larger temporary table sizes.\n\n10. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode**: Setting this to a more appropriate lock mode based on your application's use of auto-increment values can help performance.\n\n11. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: If set to 2, the log buffer is written to the log file and flushed to disk only once per second. This setting can be faster but less safe in the event of a crash.\n\n12. **skip_name_resolve**: If your application does not require DNS hostname resolution, setting this to `ON` can reduce connection times.\n\nGiven the scenario and the behavior described, focusing on parameters that enhance caching and reduce disk I/O would be most beneficial. Here's the list of recommended parameters:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_stats_on_metadata\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"skip_name_resolve\"\n]\n```"}
