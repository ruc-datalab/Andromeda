{"res": "From the description of your problem, it seems you are facing issues with the custom field implementation in Django for handling geolocation data. The issue does not directly relate to database parameters but rather to the Django model and field definitions. However, if you are looking for database parameters that could potentially influence the performance or behavior of PostgreSQL when dealing with geolocation data, here are a few parameters that might be relevant:\n\n1. **work_mem**: This parameter sets the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. Increasing this might help performance when dealing with complex queries involving large datasets, such as those that might be generated by geospatial calculations.\n\n2. **maintenance_work_mem**: This parameter sets the maximum amount of memory for maintenance operations, such as creating and rebuilding indexes which could be beneficial when dealing with large geospatial data sets.\n\n3. **temp_buffers**: This parameter sets the maximum number of temporary buffers used by each database session. These are used for temporary tables and indexes, which can be useful when manipulating large amounts of geospatial data within a session.\n\n4. **max_connections**: This parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database. If your application handles many users or processes that need to write/read geolocation data concurrently, adjusting this parameter might be necessary.\n\n5. **effective_io_concurrency**: This parameter sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously. Adjusting this can optimize the I/O performance for your specific storage system, which is beneficial when dealing with I/O-intensive operations such as those involving large geospatial datasets.\n\n6. **checkpoint_completion_target**: This parameter is used to spread out the disk I/O load associated with writing checkpoints. It can be useful to adjust this in a heavy write environment, which might be the case if you frequently update geospatial data.\n\n7. **wal_buffers**: This parameter sets the amount of memory used for WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) buffers. Since geolocation data might involve frequent updates, ensuring that WAL performance is optimized can help overall performance.\n\n8. **default_statistics_target**: This parameter sets the default statistics target for the planner to use for all tables unless overridden via specific statistics settings on table columns. For geospatial data, having more accurate statistics might help the planner generate more efficient query plans.\n\nThese parameters are general suggestions and might not directly resolve the specific issue of storing and validating geolocation data in Django. For your specific case, you might need to debug the custom field implementation in Django to handle the geolocation data correctly. Ensure that your `GeoLocationField` and `Location` class methods handle data correctly and that the `get_prep_value` method properly formats the data for storage in PostgreSQL."}
