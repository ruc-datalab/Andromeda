{"res": "Based on the detailed description and the errors encountered during the setup of MySQL Group Replication, it appears that the issue might be related to network communication or configuration settings specific to group replication. The errors \"Timeout while waiting for the group communication engine to be ready!\" and \"The group communication engine is not ready for the member to join. Local port: 33061\" suggest that there might be a problem with the group communication system (GCS) which is responsible for managing communication between nodes in the replication group.\n\nHere are some MySQL parameters that could be relevant to investigate and adjust in order to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **group_replication_group_seeds**: This parameter specifies the list of group members that the new member contacts when trying to join the group. It should include the IP addresses and ports of all group members.\n\n2. **group_replication_local_address**: This parameter sets the local address for group communication. Ensure it is correctly set to the server's private IP and the port used for group communication.\n\n3. **group_replication_ip_whitelist**: This parameter lists the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the group. Make sure that all server IPs are correctly listed here.\n\n4. **group_replication_recovery_use_ssl**: If SSL is used, ensure that all SSL settings are correctly configured and that the servers can authenticate each other.\n\n5. **group_replication_communication_debug_options**: This parameter can help to enable additional logging for the communication layer, which might provide more insights into what is going wrong.\n\n6. **group_replication_communication_max_message_size**: Check if the message size is adequate for the communication needs of your group replication setup.\n\n7. **group_replication_connect_timeout**: This parameter defines the timeout for connections to other group members. Increasing this value might help if the timeout error is due to network delays.\n\n8. **group_replication_member_expel_timeout**: Adjusting this parameter can help in situations where network issues cause members to be expelled from the group too quickly.\n\n9. **group_replication_flow_control_mode**: This parameter controls how flow control is managed in the group, which can impact how well the group handles communication under load.\n\n10. **group_replication_ssl_mode**: Ensure that the SSL mode setting matches the requirements and configuration of your environment, especially if SSL is used for group communication.\n\nThese parameters should be reviewed and configured appropriately on both servers to ensure that they can communicate effectively and that the group replication setup is optimized for your network environment. Adjusting these settings might help resolve the communication issues you are experiencing.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"group_replication_group_seeds\",\n    \"group_replication_local_address\",\n    \"group_replication_ip_whitelist\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_use_ssl\",\n    \"group_replication_communication_debug_options\",\n    \"group_replication_communication_max_message_size\",\n    \"group_replication_connect_timeout\",\n    \"group_replication_member_expel_timeout\",\n    \"group_replication_flow_control_mode\",\n    \"group_replication_ssl_mode\"\n]\n```"}
