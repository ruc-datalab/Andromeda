{"res": "Based on the error message you encountered and the information provided, it seems that you are facing an issue related to the capacity of the lock table in MySQL. The error code 147 indicates that the lock table is full. To address this issue, you need to adjust parameters that can influence the behavior and size of the lock table. However, from the list of parameters you provided, there isn't a direct parameter named \"lock table size\" or similar, which can be confusing.\n\nGiven the parameters you've listed, the most relevant ones to consider adjusting would be those related to InnoDB locking and transaction handling, as these can indirectly affect how locks are managed and stored. Here are the parameters you might consider adjusting:\n\n1. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode** - This parameter determines the lock mode for auto-increment values. Although changing this might not directly resolve the lock table full issue, it can affect how locks are used with auto-increment columns.\n2. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout** - This parameter specifies the duration in seconds an InnoDB transaction waits for a row lock before giving up. Increasing this value won't solve the lock table issue but can affect lock handling behavior.\n3. **innodb_table_locks** - This parameter controls whether InnoDB sets table locks for MySQL statements that lock tables. Disabling it might reduce the number of locks, but it can have other side effects on transaction integrity.\n4. **max_write_lock_count** - This parameter determines the maximum number of write locks before a read lock is allowed. Adjusting this might influence the lock prioritization and handling.\n\nSince none of these parameters directly increase the \"size\" of the lock table, and based on the standard MySQL and InnoDB settings, there isn't a straightforward parameter like \"lock table size\" to adjust. If you continue to experience issues, consider the following approaches:\n\n- **Optimize Queries and Indexes**: Ensure that your queries are optimized and that appropriate indexes are in place to minimize locking conflicts and duration.\n- **Hardware Considerations**: If the database is under heavy load and consistently runs into lock table limitations, consider scaling your hardware or optimizing your database configuration for performance.\n- **Review Application Logic**: Sometimes, the way applications use the database can lead to excessive locking. Review the application logic for transactions and database interactions.\n\nIf the problem persists, you might need to look into more detailed aspects of MySQL configuration or consider consulting with a database performance expert. Here's the list based on the discussion:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\", \"innodb_lock_wait_timeout\", \"innodb_table_locks\", \"max_write_lock_count\"]\n```"}
