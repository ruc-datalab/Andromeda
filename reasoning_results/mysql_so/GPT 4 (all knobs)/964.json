{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of the MySQL configuration, it appears that you have made changes to the `my.ini` file to adjust `max_connections` and `max_connect_errors`, but after restarting MySQL, the changes are not reflected. This could be due to several reasons such as editing the wrong configuration file, incorrect file permissions, or MySQL server reading from a different configuration file.\n\nTo address the issue, you should verify the following:\n\n1. **Correct Configuration File**: Ensure that you are editing the correct `my.ini` or `my.cnf` file that the MySQL server reads from at startup. You can check which configuration files are being read by MySQL using the following command:\n   ```sql\n   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'basedir';\n   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'datadir';\n   ```\n   These commands will help you identify the base directory and data directory of your MySQL installation, which often contain the configuration file.\n\n2. **File Permissions**: Check the permissions of the `my.ini` or `my.cnf` file to ensure that the MySQL server has the necessary permissions to read from it.\n\n3. **Syntax and Format**: Verify that the syntax and format of the changes in the configuration file are correct. Ensure there are no syntax errors near the edited lines.\n\n4. **Server Restart**: After making changes to the configuration file, a restart of the MySQL server is necessary for the changes to take effect. Make sure the server was successfully restarted without errors.\n\n5. **Configuration Override**: Check if there are any other configuration files or directives that might be overriding the settings specified in `my.ini`.\n\nGiven the scenario and the need to ensure the MySQL server reflects the changes made in the configuration file, here are the parameters you should focus on based on the provided configuration snippet and context:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'log_bin', 'basedir', 'datadir', 'port', 'server_id', 'max_connections', 'max_connect_errors', 'join_buffer_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_rnd_buffer_size', 'sql_mode']\n```\n\nThese parameters are relevant to the settings you are trying to adjust and are commonly used for tuning MySQL performance and behavior. Make sure these parameters are correctly set in the configuration file that the MySQL server is actually using."}
