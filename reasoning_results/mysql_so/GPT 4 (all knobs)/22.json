{"res": "To address the issue of excessive warning logs during the `LOAD DATA INFILE` operation, particularly when you are okay with the import process and want to suppress these warnings to potentially improve performance, you can adjust the following MySQL server system variables:\n\n1. **sql_notes** - This variable controls whether to log notes, including warnings generated during `LOAD DATA INFILE`. Setting this to `OFF` can suppress such warnings.\n\n2. **log_warnings** - This variable controls the generation of warning messages in the error log. Reducing the value can decrease the number of warnings logged.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\"sql_notes\", \"log_warnings\"]\n```"}
