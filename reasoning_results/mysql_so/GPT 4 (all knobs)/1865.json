{"res": "Based on the information provided, the files you are referring to are binary log files (`mysql-bin.xxxxxx`). These files are used for replication and point-in-time recovery. Since you mentioned that you do not use replication for the database, these files might not be necessary for your current setup. However, it's important to handle these files carefully to avoid data loss or corruption.\n\nHere are some recommended parameters and actions to manage and potentially remove these files safely:\n\n1. **`expire_logs_days`**: This parameter determines the number of days for automatic binary log file removal. Setting this parameter can help manage the growth of binary log files automatically.\n\n2. **`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`**: As an alternative to `expire_logs_days`, this parameter allows you to set the expiration of binary logs in seconds, providing more granular control.\n\n3. **`sync_binlog`**: This parameter ensures that the binary log is synchronized to disk. If you decide to keep binary logging enabled (for purposes other than replication, like point-in-time recovery), this parameter can help in maintaining data integrity.\n\n4. **Manual Deletion**: If you are sure that these logs are not needed (no replication and no need for point-in-time recovery), you can manually purge them using the `PURGE BINARY LOGS` command instead of directly deleting the files. This is safer as it ensures that the MySQL server's internal state and binary log index file (`mysql-bin.index`) are updated correctly.\n\n5. **`binlog_format`**: If you decide to disable binary logging completely (assuming no need for point-in-time recovery), you can set this parameter to `OFF`. However, this is a dynamic variable and cannot be changed at runtime. It must be set in the MySQL configuration file and requires a server restart.\n\n6. **`log_bin`**: This is the parameter to enable or disable binary logging. If you set this to `OFF`, remember to restart the server for changes to take effect.\n\nGiven your scenario where replication is not used, here are the recommended parameters to consider:\n\n```json\n[\"expire_logs_days\", \"binlog_expire_logs_seconds\", \"sync_binlog\", \"binlog_format\", \"log_bin\"]\n```\n\nBefore making any changes, ensure you have a complete backup of your database and understand the implications of each change related to your specific use case and MySQL version."}
