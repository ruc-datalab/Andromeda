{"res": "Based on the description of the issue you're facing with the query returning a list of lists rather than a list of dictionaries, it seems the problem might be related to how the cursor is configured when executing the SQL query. The cursor type determines the format of the fetched data. Here are some parameters that might be relevant to your situation:\n\n1. **`cursorclass`**: This parameter in the connection setup defines the type of cursor to be used. For returning dictionaries, `pymysql.cursors.DictCursor` should be used.\n\n2. **`init_connect`**: This parameter can be used to execute a set of statements at the connection start. It can be useful to set session-level settings that affect the behavior of the database connection, such as setting the cursor type if supported by the database.\n\n3. **`sql_mode`**: This parameter controls the SQL mode of the server session, which can influence how SQL queries are parsed and executed. It's not directly related to the format of the output but can affect query behavior.\n\n4. **`net_read_timeout`**, **`net_write_timeout`**: These parameters define the timeout for reading from and writing to the network in seconds. While not directly related to your issue, improper settings can cause incomplete data fetches or writes.\n\n5. **`group_concat_max_len`**: If your query uses GROUP_CONCAT, this setting controls the maximum result length in characters for the GROUP_CONCAT function. It's included here because misconfiguration might lead to truncated results, though it's not directly related to the output format.\n\n6. **`character_set_results`**: This parameter sets the character set for returning query results, which could potentially impact how results are interpreted or displayed, though not their structure as lists or dictionaries.\n\nFrom the provided list, the most relevant parameter to ensure your query returns a list of dictionaries (assuming the connection and cursor are set up correctly) is:\n\n- **`cursorclass`**\n\nEnsure that when setting up the connection, the cursor is explicitly set to use `DictCursor` as shown in your code snippet. If the issue persists even with the correct cursor type, it might be worth checking if the cursor configuration changes between queries or if there's an issue in how the queries are being executed or fetched."}
