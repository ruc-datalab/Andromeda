{"res": "To speed up the process of importing a large CSV file into MySQL, you can adjust several parameters that influence how MySQL handles large data imports. Here are some recommended parameters to modify:\n\n1. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Increase this to a larger portion of your available memory, since you have 16 GB of RAM. Setting this to about 70-80% of your RAM (while leaving enough for the operating system and other processes) can significantly improve performance. For example, setting it to 12GB could be effective.\n\n2. **`innodb_log_file_size`**: Increase the size of the log file to handle larger transactions that occur during imports. A larger log file size will allow more data to be written before a log rotation is needed.\n\n3. **`innodb_log_buffer_size`**: Increase this to ensure that a larger amount of log data can be held in memory before being written to disk. This can reduce disk I/O during the import process.\n\n4. **`max_allowed_packet`**: Increase this to maximize the size of the data packets sent to the server. This is particularly useful if your CSV contains very large rows.\n\n5. **`bulk_insert_buffer_size`**: If you are inserting into MyISAM tables, increasing this can help speed up inserts.\n\n6. **`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`**: Setting this to 2 can improve performance by writing the log to the disk at each commit but only flushing the OS buffer to disk once per second. This is less safe in terms of data integrity but can be used if performance is the priority.\n\n7. **`innodb_doublewrite`**: Disabling the doublewrite buffer (`innodb_doublewrite = 0`) can increase performance by reducing I/O overhead. Note that this makes the database more susceptible to corruption in the event of a crash.\n\n8. **`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`**: Setting this to 2 (interleaved lock mode) can improve the performance of multi-threaded insert operations by reducing auto-increment locking contention.\n\n9. **`innodb_write_io_threads`** and **`innodb_read_io_threads`**: Increasing these can allow InnoDB to perform more I/O operations concurrently, which can be beneficial during large data imports.\n\n10. **`disable_keys`**: If using MyISAM tables, disabling keys before importing and enabling them after can significantly speed up imports.\n\nHere is the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"bulk_insert_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_doublewrite\",\n    \"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"disable_keys\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should help reduce the time it takes to import large CSV files into MySQL. Make sure to test these settings in a development environment before applying them in production to ensure they work as expected without causing issues."}
