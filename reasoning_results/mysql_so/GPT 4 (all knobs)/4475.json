{"res": "To minimize memory usage on a MySQL 5.6 server running on a Windows 2008 server with 1GB of RAM, where mysqld is currently using 415MB of memory, you can adjust several parameters in your `my.ini` configuration file. The most impactful parameters to consider are:\n\n1. `key_buffer_size`: This parameter adjusts the size of the buffer used for index blocks for MyISAM tables. Since you are using InnoDB primarily, this can be set to a minimal value if you are not using MyISAM tables extensively.\n\n2. `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: This is the most critical setting for InnoDB performance as it dictates the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Reducing this value will decrease memory usage but could impact performance.\n\n3. `innodb_log_buffer_size`: This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A smaller size can save some memory but might increase disk I/O.\n\n4. `query_cache_size`: If the query cache is enabled, reducing its size can save memory. However, in MySQL 5.6, the query cache can sometimes negatively impact performance, so it might be beneficial to disable it entirely with `query_cache_type = 0`.\n\n5. `thread_stack`: This is the stack size for each thread. Reducing it can save some memory, but it should be done cautiously to avoid stack overflow errors.\n\n6. `table_open_cache`: Decreasing the number of tables that can be opened concurrently can reduce memory usage. This needs to be balanced with the number of tables accessed by your applications.\n\n7. `max_connections`: Lowering the maximum number of connections allowed can reduce memory usage, as each connection consumes resources.\n\nHere are the recommended settings in a list format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"thread_stack\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"max_connections\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjust these parameters carefully and monitor the server's performance and stability. Reducing memory usage too aggressively can lead to poor performance and other issues."}
