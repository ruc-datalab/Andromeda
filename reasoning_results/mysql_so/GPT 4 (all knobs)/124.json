{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the problem you're encountering with loading text data into MySQL tables using Python and the errors you've received, it seems the issue revolves around the use of the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` command and file path accessibility. Here are the relevant MySQL parameters and Python considerations to address:\n\n1. **local_infile**: You've already set this to `ON` in your MySQL configuration, which is necessary for using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`. Ensure this setting is enabled on both the client and server sides.\n\n2. **secure_file_priv**: This MySQL parameter restricts the directories from which MySQL can read files using statements like `LOAD DATA INFILE`. If this parameter is set, ensure your files are located within the specified directory, or adjust the parameter to include your desired path.\n\n3. **Python File Path**: The error `pymysql.err.OperationalError: (1017, \"Can't find file 'try1.txt'\")` suggests a problem with how the file path is being resolved in Python. Ensure that the file path provided to MySQL is absolute or correctly relative to the directory from which the Python script is executed.\n\n4. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the files you are trying to load are readable by the user under which the MySQL server is running. This can be a common issue especially in Unix-like systems.\n\nGiven these points, the parameters and considerations to focus on are:\n```json\n['local_infile', 'secure_file_priv']\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure your Python script correctly handles file paths and permissions to avoid operational errors."}
