{"res": "To address the issue of standardizing the capitalization of entries in a database to have initial caps (e.g., \"Nevada City\"), you would typically handle this through SQL queries or functions at the application level rather than directly through database parameters. However, if you are looking for database parameters that could indirectly assist or relate to handling string manipulation or enforcing certain formats, you might consider parameters that affect the collation and character set, as these can influence string comparison and storage. Here are some relevant parameters:\n\n1. `collation_connection`\n2. `character_set_connection`\n\nThese parameters determine the character set and collation for the connection, which can affect how string functions operate in SQL queries. Adjusting these settings can ensure that functions like `INITCAP()` in Oracle or `CONCAT()` and `UCASE()` in MySQL behave consistently.\n\nHowever, the direct task of updating entries to have initial caps would be done through an SQL query, possibly using built-in functions like `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`, `UCASE()`, and `LCASE()` in MySQL, or creating a custom function if the database supports it. Here's an example SQL query in MySQL:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE your_table\nSET your_field = CONCAT(UCASE(SUBSTRING(your_field, 1, 1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(your_field, 2)))\nWHERE your_condition;\n```\n\nThis SQL command is not directly related to database parameters but is the typical approach to solving the capitalization issue you described."}
