{"res": "To address the issue of binary logs not being purged automatically as expected, you should verify and potentially adjust the following MySQL parameters:\n\n1. **`expire_logs_days`**: This parameter is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.14 and removed in MySQL 8.0.26. Since you are using MySQL 8.0.22, this parameter should not be used. Instead, you should focus on the `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` parameter which you have already set.\n\n2. **`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`**: This is the correct parameter to set for automatic purging of binary logs based on time in seconds. Since you have already set this parameter, you should ensure it is being recognized by the MySQL server. You can verify its current value with the following SQL command:\n   ```sql\n   SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_expire_logs_seconds';\n   ```\n\n3. **Server Restart**: Changes to `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` require a server restart to take effect if set from the configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`). If set dynamically with `SET GLOBAL`, it should take effect immediately, but it's good to verify.\n\n4. **`binlog_format`**: Ensure that the binary logging is enabled and set to a format that supports automatic purging (`ROW`, `STATEMENT`, or `MIXED`). Verify this with:\n   ```sql\n   SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';\n   ```\n\n5. **`sync_binlog`**: This parameter controls the synchronization of the binary log to disk. If set to a value greater than 1, it might delay the purging process due to pending syncs. Check its value:\n   ```sql\n   SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'sync_binlog';\n   ```\n\n6. **Disk Space and Permissions**: Ensure that the MySQL server has enough disk space and proper permissions to manage and modify binary log files.\n\n7. **Error Log**: Check the MySQL error log for any messages related to binary logging or issues with log purging. This can provide clues if there are underlying issues preventing the purge operation.\n\nGiven your description, the primary focus should be on ensuring that `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` is set correctly and recognized by the server. If issues persist, consider reviewing server logs and MySQL's internal status regarding binary logs.\n\nHere is the list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n['binlog_expire_logs_seconds', 'binlog_format', 'sync_binlog']\n```"}
