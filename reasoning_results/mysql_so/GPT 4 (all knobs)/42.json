{"res": "To address the issue of synchronizing the two queries where the second query depends on the result of the first, especially when the first query might either insert a new row or update an existing one, you can consider the following approach:\n\n1. **Use of `last_insert_id()`**: This function returns the last automatically generated ID inserted into an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column. However, as you noted, it does not return the ID of the row updated by an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause. To handle this, you can modify your SQL logic to ensure that the ID of the row, whether updated or inserted, is captured correctly.\n\n2. **Modification of the SQL Query**: Instead of relying solely on `last_insert_id()`, you can adjust your SQL to capture the ID of an updated row. This can be done by using an additional `SELECT` statement to fetch the ID based on unique identifiers (like `title` in your case) if the row is updated.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised approach using SQL:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO product (title, price, `status`)\nVALUES (?, ?, ?)\nON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE price = VALUES(price), `status` = VALUES(`status`);\n\nSELECT id INTO @product_id FROM product WHERE title = ?;\n\nINSERT IGNORE INTO product_categories (product_id, category_id)\nVALUES (@product_id, ?);\n```\nIn this approach:\n- The `INSERT` statement attempts to insert a new row or update an existing one.\n- The `SELECT` statement captures the `id` of the row with the specified `title` into a user-defined variable `@product_id`.\n- The `INSERT IGNORE` uses `@product_id` for linking with the category.\n\n3. **Database Configuration Parameters**: To ensure that the above SQL executes efficiently and correctly, consider the following database parameters:\n- `autocommit`: Ensures that each individual statement is committed if not explicitly wrapped in a transaction.\n- `transaction_isolation`: Controls the level of isolation for transactions, which can prevent issues with concurrent accesses affecting the results of your queries.\n\nGiven the context and the need to ensure transactional integrity and performance, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n['autocommit', 'transaction_isolation']\n```\n\nThese parameters will help in managing how transactions are handled in your database, ensuring that changes are committed only when all operations in the transaction block are successful, and maintaining the necessary isolation level to prevent dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, or phantom reads depending on the level set."}
