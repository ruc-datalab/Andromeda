{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described, where the server crashes several times during the day with all memory and CPU being used, and considering the connection issues with Cloud SQL, here are some MySQL parameters that might help in optimizing the connection and performance:\n\n1. **connect_timeout**: Increase the timeout value to avoid connection timeouts between your PHP application and Cloud SQL.\n\n2. **max_connections**: Ensure this value is high enough to handle concurrent connections from your web server to the Cloud SQL database without reaching the limit.\n\n3. **wait_timeout**: Increase this value to prevent server-side timeouts on idle connections, which might be incorrectly perceived as hangs.\n\n4. **interactive_timeout**: Similar to `wait_timeout`, but for interactive sessions. Adjusting this might help if the application uses interactive connections.\n\n5. **net_read_timeout**: Increase this to allow more time for reading from the network if data transfers are slow.\n\n6. **net_write_timeout**: Increase this to allow more time for writing to the network, especially if large amounts of data are being sent to the database.\n\n7. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout**: Increase this if there are many row lock waits that are causing timeouts.\n\n8. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Ensure this is optimally set to use the available memory efficiently, as it holds cached data and indexes of your database.\n\n9. **innodb_log_file_size**: Ensure the log file size is sufficient for handling the transactions without causing too frequent log flushes.\n\n10. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads, which can help performance when there are many connections.\n\n11. **table_open_cache**: Increase this to reduce the number of file descriptors that MySQL needs to open and close frequently.\n\n12. **query_cache_size**: If your application has many identical queries and the data does not change often, increasing this can help improve performance.\n\n13. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Ensure these are sized appropriately to handle the temporary tables in memory without causing frequent transfers to disk-based tables.\n\n14. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjust these according to your system's I/O capacity for better handling of I/O operations.\n\n15. **skip_name_resolve**: If DNS resolution issues are suspected, enabling this option might help by using IP addresses instead of hostnames.\n\nThese parameters should be carefully tested in a staging environment before applying them to production to ensure they have the desired effect without adverse impacts. Adjustments should be made based on the observed behavior of the system after changes."}
