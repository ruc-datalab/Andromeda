{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described, where you've successfully optimized the insertion of large SQL files using the MyISAM engine for one table but are facing issues with others, it seems like there might be a need to adjust a few more parameters to optimize the performance across all tables. Here are some parameters that could potentially help in improving the insertion speed and overall database performance:\n\n1. **myisam_sort_buffer_size**: This parameter determines the buffer size for index creation. If you're altering tables to MyISAM and rebuilding indexes with `DISABLE KEYS`, increasing this might help speed up the process.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size**: Since MyISAM relies heavily on key buffers for index blocks, increasing this size can improve performance, especially for large inserts.\n\n3. **bulk_insert_buffer_size**: You've already set this to 500M, but ensuring it's adequately sized for your data volume is crucial.\n\n4. **read_buffer_size** and **read_rnd_buffer_size**: These settings control the buffer size that is used for full table scans and for reading rows in sorted order, respectively. Adjusting these might help in scenarios where data needs to be read efficiently during complex insert operations.\n\n5. **write_buffer_size**: This parameter determines the size of the buffer used for write operations. Increasing it might help in speeding up the write operations during the import.\n\n6. **max_allowed_packet**: Ensuring this is high enough to accommodate your largest possible packet size can prevent potential issues during large data imports.\n\n7. **delay_key_write**: For MyISAM tables, setting this to 'ALL' can improve the speed of mass insert operations by delaying the update of index keys.\n\n8. **concurrent_insert**: Setting this to '2' allows concurrent inserts for MyISAM tables at any point in the table, which can be beneficial during heavy insert operations.\n\n9. **low_priority_updates**: Setting this to '1' gives select statements priority over table modification statements (insert, update, delete), which might not directly speed up inserts but can help manage overall server load and responsiveness during large data imports.\n\nGiven the issue with CPU usage dropping significantly, it might also be worth investigating outside of MySQL settings:\n- **System I/O performance**: Check if there are any I/O bottlenecks.\n- **Hardware resources**: Ensure that the server has adequate CPU and memory available. It's possible that other processes or resource limits are throttling the MySQL process.\n\nHere's the output list of recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"myisam_sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"bulk_insert_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"write_buffer_size\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"delay_key_write\",\n    \"concurrent_insert\",\n    \"low_priority_updates\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should be done cautiously, monitoring the system's response to each change to find the optimal configuration."}
