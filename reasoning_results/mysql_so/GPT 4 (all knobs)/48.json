{"res": "To address the issue of incorrect character display when fetching data from a MySQL database where the field is encoded as `utf32_unicode_ci` and displaying it in an HTML page encoded in UTF-8, you need to ensure that the character set settings in your MySQL database connection are correctly configured to handle UTF-8 encoding. This involves setting the appropriate parameters for the character set of the client, connection, and results. Here are the recommended parameters:\n\n- `character_set_client`: This parameter sets the character set for the client. It should be set to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' to ensure that the client (in this case, your PHP script) sends SQL statements to the server using UTF-8 encoding.\n- `character_set_connection`: This parameter sets the character set for the connection itself. Setting this to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' ensures that the server interprets the statements sent by the client as UTF-8.\n- `character_set_results`: This parameter sets the character set for the results returned by the server. Setting this to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' ensures that the results are returned in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nHere is the output list of these parameters:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n```"}
