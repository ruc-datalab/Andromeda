{"res": "To address the issue you're facing with the charset `utf8mb4` and the error related to key length in MySQL, especially considering the possibility of running on MySQL 5.5, you need to adjust several parameters and configurations. However, directly querying the MySQL version inside the `config/database.php` using Laravel's DB facade is not feasible because this file is not meant to handle dynamic logic and the Laravel framework is not fully loaded at this point, which is why you're seeing the error \"A facade root has not been set.\"\n\nHere are some steps and parameters you can consider:\n\n1. **Set Default String Length in AppServiceProvider**: You've mentioned trying this, but ensure it's correctly set up in the `boot` method of your `AppServiceProvider`:\n\n   ```php\n   use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;\n\n   public function boot()\n   {\n       Schema::defaultStringLength(191); // For MySQL 5.5 support with utf8mb4\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Database Engine and Row Format**: Setting the InnoDB engine to use `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` is correct, but ensure it's applied globally or at least consistently across migrations where you face issues.\n\n3. **Check MySQL Version Before Migration**: Instead of trying to execute this in `config/database.php`, handle this within a migration or a command where you have full access to Laravel's features. You can conditionally apply migrations or index lengths based on the MySQL version.\n\n   ```php\n   use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\DB;\n\n   $version = DB::select(DB::raw('select version() as mysql_version'));\n   if (version_compare($version[0]->mysql_version, '5.7.7', '<')) {\n       Schema::defaultStringLength(191);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Configuration Parameters**: Since you're dealing with MySQL version compatibility and charset issues, here are relevant MySQL configuration parameters that might be useful if you have access to set them in your MySQL server configuration:\n\n   - `innodb_file_format`: Set to `Barracuda` for MySQL versions before 5.7.7 to support `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC`.\n   - `innodb_large_prefix`: Enable this option to allow index key prefixes longer than 767 bytes (up to 3072 bytes).\n\n   These parameters are not directly settable via Laravel but require access to the MySQL server configuration files or server startup command.\n\n5. **Migration Adjustments**: In your migrations, explicitly define the table engine and row format if not set globally:\n\n   ```php\n   Schema::create('your_table', function (Blueprint $table) {\n       $table->engine = 'InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC';\n       $table->string('taggable_type', 255)->index();\n   });\n   ```\n\n6. **Handling Older MySQL Versions**: If you must support older MySQL versions and cannot change server settings, consider reducing the string lengths or using a different charset like `utf8` which has a lower maximum byte length per character.\n\nGiven your scenario, the parameters and configurations you might need to consider are:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_file_format\", \"innodb_large_prefix\"]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help you manage the charset and index length issues across different MySQL versions, especially in environments where you do not have full control over the MySQL server settings."}
