{"res": "The error you're encountering is related to the maximum row size limit in InnoDB tables. This is a common issue when dealing with wide tables that have many columns or large column sizes, especially with text or blob data types. The `tmp` database mentioned in the error typically refers to internal temporary tables that MySQL creates for various operations like complex joins, sorts, or query results that cannot be held in memory.\n\nTo address this issue, you can consider the following parameters that influence the behavior and handling of InnoDB tables and temporary table sizes:\n\n1. **`innodb_page_size`**: This parameter determines the size of the pages used to store data. Larger page sizes allow more data to be stored in a single row on a page, but they also require more memory and disk space. Adjusting this might help accommodate larger rows.\n\n2. **`innodb_strict_mode`**: When enabled, this makes InnoDB enforce stricter checks on conditions that are considered unsafe, such as row size limitations. Disabling this might allow some operations to proceed that would otherwise be halted, but it can lead to data truncation.\n\n3. **`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`**: This parameter determines the storage engine used for on-disk internal temporary tables. Changing the storage engine might affect how data is stored and potentially influence the maximum row size.\n\n4. **`tmp_table_size`** and **`max_heap_table_size`**: These parameters specify the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, it is automatically converted to an on-disk temporary table. Adjusting these values might reduce the frequency of on-disk temporary table creation, although it won't directly solve the row size issue.\n\n5. **`innodb_file_per_table`**: This setting controls whether InnoDB creates a separate file for each table. While it doesn't directly impact the row size issue, it can affect overall database management and performance, which might indirectly influence how temporary tables are handled.\n\nGiven the specific error message and context, the most directly relevant parameters to consider adjusting would be:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_page_size\", \"innodb_strict_mode\", \"internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\"]\n```\n\nThese adjustments can help manage the limitations you're encountering with row sizes in temporary tables. However, it's also important to review the design of the tables and queries that are leading to the creation of such wide temporary tables, as this might indicate deeper issues with database schema or query efficiency."}
