{"res": "Based on the user's issue and the details provided, it seems the problem is related to PHP configuration and not directly related to database parameters. However, since the user is experiencing issues with memory limits in PHP, which is affecting the operation of PHPMailer, the relevant parameters to consider would be those related to PHP's configuration for memory allocation. \n\nSince the user's problem is about PHP's `memory_limit` setting not being updated as expected, and there's no direct database parameter that would solve this issue, the closest related parameters from the provided list would be those that might indirectly affect the performance or behavior of PHP when interacting with the database. However, none of these parameters directly address PHP configuration issues.\n\nTherefore, the correct response would be:\n```json\n[]\n```\nThis indicates that none of the database parameters listed are relevant to solving the PHP `memory_limit` configuration issue described. The user should focus on resolving PHP configuration file issues, ensuring the correct `php.ini` is being loaded, and that server permissions and restart procedures are correctly handled to apply changes."}
