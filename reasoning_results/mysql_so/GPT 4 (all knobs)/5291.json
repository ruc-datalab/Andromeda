{"res": "Given the scenario where your MySQL database is experiencing daily crashes and you've noticed a mixture of table types, the following parameters could be relevant to investigate and potentially adjust to address issues related to table types and stability:\n\n1. **`default_storage_engine`**: This parameter determines the default storage engine for new tables when a storage engine is not specified during table creation. Adjusting this might help standardize the creation of new tables to a single type, reducing complexity.\n\n2. **`disabled_storage_engines`**: This parameter allows you to disable certain storage engines, which could be useful if you want to enforce the use of a specific engine across your database to maintain consistency and potentially avoid issues caused by mixing engine types.\n\n3. **`innodb_strict_mode`**: When enabled, this parameter makes InnoDB produce more errors and warnings instead of silently applying workarounds for problematic data manipulations or table definitions. This could help identify issues related to table types and configurations that might be contributing to the crashes.\n\n4. **`table_open_cache`**: This parameter determines the number of open tables for all threads. Inadequate settings here can lead to performance issues, especially if different table types handle caching differently.\n\n5. **`innodb_file_per_table`**: This parameter controls whether InnoDB creates a separate file for each table. If set to ON, it might help manage InnoDB tables better and isolate issues specific to InnoDB tables from affecting others.\n\n6. **`myisam_recover_options`**: This parameter sets the recovery mode for MyISAM tables. Adjusting this setting can help in recovering from crashes involving MyISAM tables.\n\nThese parameters can help in managing and potentially resolving issues arising from having multiple storage engines and table types in your MySQL database. Adjusting them should be done with caution and ideally tested in a staging environment before applying to production."}
