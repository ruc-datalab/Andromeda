{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the MySQL query seems to be related to the database schema rather than specific MySQL server parameters. The error message \"Unknown table 'tbl_trade' in field list\" indicates that the table `tbl_trade` is not recognized in the current database context. This could be due to various reasons such as the table not existing in the database, a typo in the table name, or the query being run in the wrong database schema.\n\nRegarding the conversion of the MS Access `DatePart` function to MySQL, the `DatePart` function in MS Access allows for more complex date part extractions using additional parameters which MySQL's date functions like `YEAR()` or `EXTRACT()` do not directly support. MySQL's date functions are more straightforward and do not support the same level of customization directly in the function call as MS Access does with its start and firstday parameters.\n\nTo address your needs:\n1. **Ensure the table exists**: Check that the `tbl_trade` table exists in your MySQL database. You can do this by running `SHOW TABLES;` and looking for `tbl_trade` in the output.\n2. **Check database context**: Make sure you are connected to the correct database where `tbl_trade` exists. You can select the database with `USE database_name;` before running your queries.\n3. **Simplify the query**: If you are only extracting the year from the date, MySQL's `YEAR()` function is sufficient. The additional parameters in MS Access's `DatePart` function do not have direct equivalents in MySQL and would typically require more complex SQL logic or handling outside of SQL if necessary.\n\nSince the problem is not related to configurable server parameters but rather to SQL query execution and database schema management, there are no specific \"parameters\" from the provided list to recommend for this issue. Instead, focus on verifying the database schema and context as mentioned above."}
