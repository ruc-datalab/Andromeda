{"res": "Based on the information provided and the error encountered while trying to install the group replication plugin, it appears that the `group_replication.so` library file is missing from the plugin directory. This suggests that the plugin may not be installed or included in your MySQL installation package. Here are a few steps and checks you can consider:\n\n1. **Verify MySQL Version for Group Replication Support**: Ensure that your MySQL version explicitly supports group replication. While MySQL 5.7.21 should support it, it's crucial to confirm that the specific distribution or build you are using includes the group replication plugin.\n\n2. **Check MySQL Distribution**: Some MySQL distributions, especially those customized by certain providers or for specific operating systems, might not include all plugins. You might need to switch to a different MySQL distribution or manually obtain the plugin files.\n\n3. **Install Missing Plugin**: If the plugin is indeed supported but not present, you might need to install it manually or reinstall MySQL ensuring that the group replication plugin is included.\n\n4. **Configuration File Check**: Ensure that your configuration file (`my.cnf`) is correctly set up for group replication, though this seems to be in order based on the provided configuration.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation and Community**: Check the MySQL documentation and community forums for any similar issues and solutions or guidance on installing missing plugins.\n\n6. **Contact Support**: If you're using a managed MySQL service or an enterprise version, consider reaching out to the support team for assistance with the plugin installation.\n\nGiven the scenario and the error message, the issue is likely due to the absence of the `group_replication.so` file in the plugin directory. Here are the parameters and actions you might consider:\n\n- **Check Plugin Installation**: Verify if the plugin is correctly installed and recognized by MySQL.\n- **Review MySQL Installation**: Ensure that the MySQL installation includes support for group replication and that all necessary components are installed.\n\nSince the problem is specifically about the missing plugin file and not about configuration parameters, the solution would involve ensuring the availability of `group_replication.so` in the MySQL plugin directory. Here's the output list focusing on the installation and verification steps:\n\n```json\n[\"plugin_dir\", \"group_replication\"]\n```\n\nThese parameters and checks are crucial for diagnosing and resolving the issue with the group replication plugin installation."}
