{"res": "The error you're encountering, \"ERROR: cannot execute CREATE SCHEMA in a read-only transaction,\" suggests that the transaction mode of your PostgreSQL session is set to read-only. This can happen due to specific settings in your PostgreSQL configuration or the session-level settings that are applied when you connect to the database.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can adjust the following parameters to ensure that your database session is not restricted to read-only transactions:\n\n1. **`default_transaction_read_only`**: This parameter determines whether transactions are read-only by default. Setting this to `off` allows transactions to write to the database.\n\n2. **`transaction_read_only`**: Similar to the above, this parameter controls whether the current session is read-only. It should also be set to `off` to allow write operations like `CREATE SCHEMA`.\n\nHere is the list of parameters you might consider adjusting:\n\n```plaintext\n['default_transaction_read_only', 'transaction_read_only']\n```\n\nMake sure to check your PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`) or issue the appropriate SQL command to change these settings for your session before running your script. For example:\n\n```sql\nSET default_transaction_read_only = off;\n```\n\nor\n\n```sql\nSET transaction_read_only = off;\n```\n\nThese commands can be executed in the `psql` command-line interface before you run your SQL script. Alternatively, review any session-level configurations or connection parameters in your client that might be setting the session to read-only."}
