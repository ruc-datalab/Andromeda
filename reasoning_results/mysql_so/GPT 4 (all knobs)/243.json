{"res": "Based on the issue described, where the PHP page is fetching data that appears as non-Unicode text despite the database using UTF8 collation, the problem likely lies in the connection settings between the PHP application and the MySQL database. The parameters that need to be adjusted are those that ensure the connection, client, and results are properly set to use UTF-8 encoding. Here are the relevant MySQL parameters:\n\n1. `character_set_client` - This parameter sets the character set for the client. It should be set to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' to ensure that the client sends the queries in UTF-8 encoding.\n2. `character_set_connection` - This sets the character set for the connection itself. Setting this to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' ensures that the server interprets the statements sent by the client as UTF-8.\n3. `character_set_results` - This parameter determines the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. It should also be set to 'utf8' or 'utf8mb4' to ensure that results are returned in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nThese settings can be enforced in the MySQL configuration or set dynamically per session in the PHP script before executing queries. Here is how you might set these parameters dynamically in PHP:\n\n```php\nmysqli_query($connection, \"SET character_set_client = 'utf8mb4'\");\nmysqli_query($connection, \"SET character_set_connection = 'utf8mb4'\");\nmysqli_query($connection, \"SET character_set_results = 'utf8mb4'\");\n```\n\nOr using PDO:\n\n```php\n$connection->exec(\"SET character_set_client = 'utf8mb4'\");\n$connection->exec(\"SET character_set_connection = 'utf8mb4'\");\n$connection->exec(\"SET character_set_results = 'utf8mb4'\");\n```\n\nEnsure these settings are applied before performing any queries to the database. This should resolve the issue with incorrect character encoding in the output.\n\nOutput list of parameters:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n```"}
