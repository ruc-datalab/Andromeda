{"res": "Based on the provided scenario, the issue seems to be related to the format of the datetime values being inserted into the database. The error \"Data truncated for column 'datetime_gmt' at row 1\" typically occurs when the datetime format in the input data does not match the expected format of the datetime column in the database.\n\nIn MySQL, the standard datetime format is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. If the input data does not match this format, MySQL may not be able to parse it correctly, leading to truncation errors.\n\nFrom the sample data provided:\n```\n2013-12-11 8:22:00, 1.462E+12, 3.33E+11 \n2013-12-12 4:10:00, 1.462E+12, 3.33E+11 \n2013-12-13 11:52:00, 1.462E+12, 3.33E+11 \n```\nIt appears that the datetime values might be missing leading zeros for hours, which could potentially cause issues during parsing. For example, '8:22:00' should be '08:22:00'.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for database parameters, and considering the context of the error, there are no specific MySQL server parameters that directly resolve format mismatches in datetime values during inserts. The solution would typically involve correcting the datetime format in the application layer (PHP code) before insertion.\n\nIf there were parameters to adjust, they might involve server settings that are not directly related to the error but could be considered for overall database operations. Since none of the parameters directly address the issue described, the response would be:\n```json\n[]\n```\nThis indicates that no specific database parameters from the provided list would resolve the issue of datetime format mismatches during data insertion. The correction needs to be handled in the application logic or by preprocessing the data to match the expected datetime format."}
