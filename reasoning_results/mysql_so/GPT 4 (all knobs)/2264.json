{"res": "Based on the error message you received in MySQL Workbench and the behavior of your script, it appears that the issue is related to the MySQL server operating in \"safe update mode.\" This mode prevents certain types of updates that do not use a key column in the WHERE clause or do not limit the number of rows affected. The parameter that controls this behavior in MySQL is `sql_safe_updates`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can either adjust your query to meet the requirements of safe update mode or change the setting of `sql_safe_updates` to allow the update to proceed without these restrictions. However, changing this setting can have implications for the safety and integrity of your data, so it should be done with caution.\n\nHere is the recommended parameter based on your description:\n\n```json\n['sql_safe_updates']\n```"}
