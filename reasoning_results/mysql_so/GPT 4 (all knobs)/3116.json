{"res": "The SQL syntax error in the provided stored procedure is not directly related to database configuration parameters, but rather to errors in the SQL syntax and the use of variables within the procedure. However, I can provide some general MySQL configuration parameters that might be relevant when dealing with stored procedures, user management, and timestamp operations:\n\n1. `event_scheduler`: Enables or disables the event scheduler, which can be useful for automatically running maintenance tasks such as disabling expired users.\n2. `default_authentication_plugin`: Determines the authentication method, which could be relevant for user management.\n3. `timestamp`: Affects the display and storage of timestamp values.\n4. `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`: Controls whether TIMESTAMP columns declared without an explicit NULL or NOT NULL attribute are treated as NULL or NOT NULL by default.\n\nHere's the list of relevant parameters based on the context of managing users and handling timestamp operations in stored procedures:\n\n```json\n['event_scheduler', 'default_authentication_plugin', 'timestamp', 'explicit_defaults_for_timestamp']\n```"}
