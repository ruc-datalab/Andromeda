{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the Bengali fonts being displayed as \"?????????????\" typically arises from a mismatch in character encoding settings between your database and your application. To ensure that the data is handled correctly in terms of encoding, you need to set the appropriate character set parameters in your MySQL database configuration. Here are the relevant parameters to adjust:\n\n1. **`character_set_client`** - This parameter sets the character set for the client. It should match the character set you intend to use in your application, which in this case is likely UTF-8 if you are dealing with Bengali fonts.\n\n2. **`character_set_connection`** - This sets the character set for the connection between the client and the server. It should also be set to UTF-8 to handle Bengali characters correctly.\n\n3. **`character_set_results`** - This parameter determines the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. Again, setting this to UTF-8 is advisable.\n\n4. **`character_set_database`** - This sets the default character set for the database. Setting this to UTF-8 ensures that any new tables or other database objects use UTF-8 by default.\n\n5. **`character_set_server`** - This sets the server\u2019s default character set. Setting this to UTF-8 ensures that all operations processed by the server use UTF-8 by default.\n\n6. **`collation_connection`** - This sets the collation for the connection, which should correspond to the character set, e.g., `utf8_general_ci` or a specific collation that supports Bengali characters if available.\n\n7. **`collation_database`** - This sets the default collation for the database, which should be compatible with the `character_set_database`.\n\n8. **`collation_server`** - This sets the default server collation. It should be set to a collation that matches the `character_set_server`.\n\nTo implement these settings, you can configure them in your MySQL server's configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), typically under the `[mysqld]` section. After making these changes, restart your MySQL server for the changes to take effect. Additionally, ensure your PHP connection script specifies UTF-8 as the character set when connecting to MySQL, which can be done using:\n\n```php\nmysqli_set_charset($con, \"utf8\");\n```\n\nThis line should be added right after the connection is established and before any queries are executed.\n\nHere is the output list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"character_set_client\",\n  \"character_set_connection\",\n  \"character_set_results\",\n  \"character_set_database\",\n  \"character_set_server\",\n  \"collation_connection\",\n  \"collation_database\",\n  \"collation_server\"\n]\n```"}
