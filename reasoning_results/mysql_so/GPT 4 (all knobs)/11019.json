{"res": "Based on the error logs and the situation described, the issue seems to be related to the binary logs on the master having been purged, which contain GTIDs required by the crashed node trying to rejoin the cluster. The node is unable to retrieve the necessary transaction logs for recovery, leading to failure in synchronization with the cluster.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider adjusting the following parameters to help manage binary logs and GTID purging, ensuring that necessary logs are retained until all nodes have successfully synchronized:\n\n1. `gtid_mode`: Ensures that GTIDs (Global Transaction Identifiers) are consistently used, which is crucial for replication and recovery in a cluster setup.\n2. `enforce_gtid_consistency`: Guarantees that only GTID-consistent statements are allowed, which helps in maintaining a consistent state across the cluster.\n3. `binlog_format`: Should be set to `ROW` to ensure that the binary log contains log events for each row that is changed, which is necessary for MySQL Group Replication.\n4. `expire_logs_days`: Adjust this setting to ensure binary logs are kept for a sufficient duration to allow recovery of any node.\n5. `slave_parallel_type`: This parameter can be set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK` to improve the efficiency of applying changes on the recovering node.\n6. `slave_preserve_commit_order`: Enabling this ensures that transactions are committed in the same order on the slave as on the master, which is important for consistency in a replication setup.\n7. `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`: Setting this to `WRITESET` can help optimize parallel replication.\n8. `group_replication_autorejoin_tries`: Adjust this to allow the node more attempts to automatically rejoin the cluster after a failure.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted to help manage how binary logs and GTIDs are handled, potentially resolving issues related to nodes being unable to rejoin a cluster due to missing transaction logs:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"gtid_mode\",\n    \"enforce_gtid_consistency\",\n    \"binlog_format\",\n    \"expire_logs_days\",\n    \"slave_parallel_type\",\n    \"slave_preserve_commit_order\",\n    \"binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking\",\n    \"group_replication_autorejoin_tries\"\n]\n```"}
