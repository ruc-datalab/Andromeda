{"res": "From the description and the SQL code provided, it seems that your main concerns are related to the management of database records, particularly with respect to the order of operations when inserting, updating, and deleting records due to the constraints and relationships between tables. The issues you're facing, such as the error during data import due to duplicate primary keys, are related to the logical structure and handling of your database rather than specific database parameters that can be tuned.\n\nHowever, to address the broader question of managing records dynamically and ensuring operations like cascading deletes are handled correctly, here are some general recommendations and considerations:\n\n1. **Foreign Key Constraints and ON DELETE CASCADE**: Ensure your foreign key constraints are set up correctly to automatically handle deletions. For example, if a `Personne` is deleted, all related `TelPers` entries should also be deleted if they are no longer relevant. This is managed by the `ON DELETE CASCADE` option in your foreign key constraints.\n\n2. **Transaction Management**: Use transactions to ensure that your insert, update, and delete operations are processed reliably. This helps in maintaining data integrity, especially when multiple related operations need to be performed together.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your application to manage issues like duplicate entries or constraint violations. This can involve checking for errors during SQL operations and taking appropriate actions (e.g., retrying the operation, rolling back a transaction, or informing the user).\n\n4. **Database Design**: Review and optimize your database schema. For example, ensure that primary keys are unique and consider if auto-increment is suitable for your use case to prevent duplicate key issues.\n\n5. **Data Import Strategy**: When importing data, especially in bulk, ensure that the data does not violate any primary key constraints or foreign key constraints. This might involve cleaning or preprocessing data before import or using tools that can handle such exceptions gracefully.\n\n6. **Indexing**: Proper indexing can help in speeding up query performance, especially for large datasets and complex joins. However, this is more about read performance rather than insert/delete operations.\n\nGiven these points, while there are no specific \"database parameters\" to tune from the provided list that would directly resolve your issues, focusing on database design, transaction management, and error handling in your application logic is key. Here are some conceptual \"parameters\" or areas you might consider:\n\n- **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode**: Ensures proper handling of auto-increment values and might be relevant if you're facing issues with auto-increment fields during concurrent inserts.\n- **foreign_key_checks**: Temporarily disable this during bulk imports to avoid constraint checks for each row, then re-enable and validate the data afterward.\n- **autocommit**: Control this setting within your session if you're using transactions to group multiple operations.\n\nThus, the response in terms of database parameters might look like:\n```json\n[\"innodb_autoinc_lock_mode\", \"foreign_key_checks\", \"autocommit\"]\n```\n\nThese are more about ensuring that the operations on your database respect transaction boundaries and integrity constraints, which seems to be at the heart of your concerns."}
