{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the `AES_DECRYPT` function in MySQL is likely due to a misunderstanding of the required parameters for the function. In MySQL, the `AES_DECRYPT()` function requires two parameters: the data to decrypt and the encryption key. However, starting from MySQL 5.6.17, the function also requires an explicit specification of the encryption algorithm and mode if it is not the default.\n\nGiven that you are using MySQL version 5.6.22 and the error message indicates an incorrect parameter count, it suggests that the encryption mode and/or algorithm might need to be explicitly specified, even though the default should technically work without it. This could be due to specific server settings or configurations that change the expected behavior.\n\nHere are the parameters related to encryption that you might need to review or adjust:\n\n1. **`block_encryption_mode`** - This parameter defines the algorithm and block encryption mode used for encryption functions like `AES_ENCRYPT()` and `AES_DECRYPT()`. The default value typically is `aes-128-ecb`, but if your server configuration or specific use case requires a different mode or if there is a compatibility issue, you might need to set this parameter explicitly.\n\n2. **`innodb_encrypt_tables`** - If you are using InnoDB tables and want to ensure they are encrypted, this parameter can be set. This isn't directly related to your current issue but is relevant for overall database encryption strategies.\n\n3. **`innodb_encryption_threads`** - This parameter determines the number of background threads used for encryption and decryption of InnoDB tablespaces. Again, this is more about tablespace encryption rather than function-based encryption.\n\n4. **`innodb_encryption_rotate_key_age`** - Controls key rotation for InnoDB tablespace encryption.\n\nFor your specific case, you might want to try specifying the encryption mode explicitly in your `AES_DECRYPT` function call to see if that resolves the issue. For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AES_DECRYPT(u.strFirstName, 'usa2010', 'aes-128-ecb') FROM EncryptingTest.tblUser u;\n```\n\nIf specifying the encryption mode does not resolve the issue, ensure that your MySQL server's system variables related to encryption are correctly configured and that there are no overrides in place that might affect the behavior of encryption functions.\n\nBased on the information provided and the context of MySQL encryption function usage, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n```json\n['block_encryption_mode']\n```"}
