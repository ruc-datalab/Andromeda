{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where a recurring event in MySQL is supposed to execute a DELETE operation every minute but is not functioning as expected, we need to consider parameters that could influence the behavior of scheduled events and time-related operations in MySQL. Here are some relevant parameters:\n\n1. **event_scheduler**: This parameter enables or disables the event scheduler. If it's turned off, scheduled events will not trigger.\n\n2. **time_zone**: This controls the time zone setting for the MySQL server. Even though you mentioned that time zones aren't the problem, it's crucial to ensure that the server's time zone matches the expected settings for accurate scheduling and time calculations.\n\n3. **log_error**: This parameter specifies the file where errors are logged. Checking this could provide insights if the event fails to execute due to errors.\n\n4. **log_output**: This determines the destination of log output, which can be TABLE, FILE, or NONE. If set to TABLE, you can query the `mysql.general_log` and `mysql.slow_log` tables for logs that might indicate issues with the event execution.\n\n5. **general_log**: If enabled, this logs every general event, including queries like your DELETE operation. This can be useful for debugging.\n\n6. **event_scheduler**: Ensures that the event scheduler is active, as it is responsible for executing events.\n\nThese parameters can be crucial in diagnosing why the DELETE operation isn't being executed as expected by the event scheduler. Here's the list formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\"event_scheduler\", \"time_zone\", \"log_error\", \"log_output\", \"general_log\"]\n```"}
