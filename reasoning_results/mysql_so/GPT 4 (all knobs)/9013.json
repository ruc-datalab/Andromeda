{"res": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the host IP address is being blocked due to too many connection errors. This typically happens when there are repeated failed attempts to connect to the MySQL server, causing MySQL to block the host to prevent potential abuse. Here are some relevant MySQL parameters and settings that can help you manage and investigate this issue:\n\n1. **`max_connect_errors`**: This parameter determines the number of consecutive failed connection attempts allowed before MySQL blocks a host. Increasing this value can help if your development environment frequently makes erroneous connection attempts due to intermittent issues.\n\n2. **`log_error`**: This parameter specifies the file where MySQL writes error logs. Reviewing the error log can provide insights into why the connection attempts are failing.\n\n3. **`log_warnings`**: This parameter controls the logging of warning messages to the error log. Setting this to a higher value can increase the verbosity of the logs, potentially capturing more details about connection errors.\n\n4. **`skip_name_resolve`**: If this parameter is enabled, MySQL skips DNS resolution for client connections. DNS issues can sometimes cause connection delays or failures, leading to increased connection errors.\n\nTo address and further investigate the issue, consider the following steps:\n\n- **Increase `max_connect_errors`**: Temporarily increase this value to prevent frequent blocking while you diagnose the connection issues.\n  \n  ```sql\n  SET GLOBAL max_connect_errors = 10000;\n  ```\n\n- **Review Error Logs**: Check the MySQL error log file specified by the `log_error` parameter for any indicative messages about the connection failures.\n\n- **Check DNS Settings**: If DNS resolution issues are suspected, consider enabling `skip_name_name_resolve` to see if it mitigates the problem.\n\n- **Network Issues**: Ensure there are no underlying network issues between your development machine and the MySQL server.\n\n- **Flush Hosts Regularly**: If the issue persists and is causing significant disruption, you might automate the flushing of hosts as a temporary workaround while investigating the root cause.\n\n- **Connection Code Review**: Review the database connection code in your CodeIgniter application. Ensure that it handles connection failures gracefully and doesn't inadvertently cause rapid successive connection attempts that could lead to the host being blocked.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters and following the investigation steps, you should be able to better manage and diagnose the connection issues you're experiencing with your MySQL server from your CodeIgniter application."}
