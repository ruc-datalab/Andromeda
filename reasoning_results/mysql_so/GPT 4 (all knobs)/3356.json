{"res": "To clear the InnoDB buffer pool to ensure that you are comparing the performance of two large queries from the same starting point without restarting the MySQL server, you can use the following parameters:\n\n1. `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now` - This parameter allows you to dump the current state of the buffer pool to disk immediately.\n2. `innodb_buffer_pool_load_now` - This parameter allows you to clear the buffer pool and then reload the state from a previously dumped state.\n\nHowever, to simply clear the buffer pool without dumping and reloading, you can set:\n\n3. `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown` - This parameter ensures that the buffer pool's current state is dumped at server shutdown.\n4. `innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup` - This parameter controls whether the buffer pool is preloaded with the previously saved contents at server startup.\n\nFor your specific case where you want to clear the buffer pool without restarting the server, you can dynamically set `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now` to dump the current state (if needed for later), and then use `innodb_buffer_pool_load_now` without actually having a prior dump to effectively clear the buffer pool.\n\nHere is the output list of parameters based on your requirements:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now', 'innodb_buffer_pool_load_now', 'innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown', 'innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup']\n```"}
