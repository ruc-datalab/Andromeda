{"res": "To address the SQL query issue where you need to find rows based on keys present in a JSON column (`contacts`), you can use the JSONB data type functions and operators provided by PostgreSQL (assuming you are using PostgreSQL as it supports JSON and JSONB types). The function `jsonb_object_keys` can be used to extract keys from a JSONB object, but it cannot be directly used in the `WHERE` clause as it is a set-returning function.\n\nInstead, you can use the `jsonb` data type and its operators to check for the existence of a key directly in the `WHERE` clause. If your `contacts` column is not already a `jsonb` type, consider casting it to `jsonb` for this operation.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify the query to achieve the desired result:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users\nWHERE contacts::jsonb ? $2;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `contacts::jsonb` casts the `contacts` column to `jsonb` if it's not already.\n- The `?` operator checks if the key (`$2`) exists in the `jsonb` object.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages the JSONB operators available in PostgreSQL for checking the presence of a key in a JSONB object.\n\nSince you asked for database parameters related to this operation, here are some relevant parameters that might influence the performance or behavior of JSON operations in PostgreSQL:\n\n```json\n['work_mem', 'shared_buffers', 'effective_cache_size', 'maintenance_work_mem', 'jsonb_pretty_print']\n```\n\nThese parameters can affect the overall performance of queries and operations involving JSON data:\n- `work_mem`: Amount of memory used for sorting and other operations; increasing this might help with performance when dealing with large JSON objects.\n- `shared_buffers`: The amount of memory the database uses for caching data, including JSON data.\n- `effective_cache_size`: An estimate of the effective memory available for caching data.\n- `maintenance_work_mem`: Memory used for maintenance operations such as creating indexes on JSONB columns.\n- `jsonb_pretty_print`: Not a performance-related setting but affects the output format of JSONB values in the output.\n\nThese settings should be tuned based on the specific workload and database configuration."}
