{"res": "To view MySQL query errors and warnings in RDS, especially when upgrading from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7, you should focus on parameters that specifically control error and warning logging. Since you mentioned that setting `general_log=1` generates too much information and does not log the errors you're interested in, you should consider adjusting the following parameters to better capture the necessary information:\n\n1. `log_error_verbosity` - This parameter controls the verbosity of the error log. Increasing its value can help capture more detailed error and warning messages. In MySQL 5.6, this parameter might not be available, so you would need to adjust this in MySQL 5.7 after the upgrade.\n\n2. `log_warnings` - You've already set this to 1, but in MySQL 5.7, you can increase it to a higher value to log more warning messages. This parameter is deprecated in MySQL 5.7.9 and later, replaced by `log_error_verbosity`.\n\n3. `log_error` - Ensures that the path and file name for the error log are correctly set so that errors are indeed being written to the log.\n\n4. `slow_query_log` - Enable this to log queries that take a long time to execute, which might indirectly help you catch problematic queries that could also be throwing warnings.\n\n5. `log_slow_admin_statements` - Set this to log slow administrative statements (like ALTER TABLE, etc.) which might be relevant during your upgrade process.\n\n6. `log_queries_not_using_indexes` - Enable this to log queries that do not utilize indexes. These queries might not be directly related to errors but can help in optimizing the database and potentially avoiding future warnings or errors.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters based on your needs:\n\n```json\n['log_error_verbosity', 'log_warnings', 'log_error', 'slow_query_log', 'log_slow_admin_statements', 'log_queries_not_using_indexes']\n```"}
