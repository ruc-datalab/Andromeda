{"res": "To optimize the performance of the MySQL stored procedure you provided, especially focusing on the aspects related to temporary tables and function calls within your queries, you can consider adjusting the following database parameters:\n\n1. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Increase this parameter to ensure that there is enough memory for MySQL to cache data, which can reduce disk I/O for operations involving temporary tables.\n\n2. **`tmp_table_size`** and **`max_heap_table_size`**: These parameters determine the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. If exceeded, MySQL will convert the in-memory temporary table to an on-disk table. Increasing these values might prevent the on-disk temporary table conversion if the dataset fits into the increased limits.\n\n3. **`innodb_log_buffer_size`**: Increasing this parameter can reduce the frequency of log flushes to disk, which can be beneficial if your stored procedure is causing a lot of log activity due to temporary table operations.\n\n4. **`innodb_log_file_size`**: A larger log file size can handle more data changes before needing to wrap around. This can be particularly useful if transactions in the stored procedures are large.\n\n5. **`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`**: Adjusting this parameter can help balance between durability and performance. Setting it to 2 can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file and flushing it to disk once per second rather than at every commit.\n\n6. **`query_cache_size`** (if using a version of MySQL that still supports the query cache): If your stored procedure is run frequently with the same parameters, enabling and tuning the query cache can reduce execution time.\n\n7. **`innodb_thread_concurrency`** and **`thread_handling`**: These parameters can be adjusted to optimize how threads are managed in InnoDB. This is useful if you have multiple concurrent executions of your stored procedures.\n\n8. **`innodb_io_capacity`** and **`innodb_io_capacity_max`**: These settings affect the I/O throughput for background tasks in InnoDB, including purging and page flushing, which can indirectly impact the performance of operations involving temporary tables.\n\n9. **`sort_buffer_size`**: Since your procedure might involve sorting operations when executing queries, increasing this buffer size might help, especially if the default size is too small for the data sets being sorted.\n\n10. **`read_rnd_buffer_size`**: This parameter is used after a sort operation to read rows in sorted order. If your queries involve sorting and then reading, tuning this parameter might help.\n\nThese parameters should be adjusted carefully and tested in a development or staging environment before being applied in production, as they can affect overall server performance and stability. Always monitor the system's response to changes and revert or adjust as necessary based on the observed performance."}
