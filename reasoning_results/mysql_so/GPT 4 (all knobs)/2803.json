{"res": "To log queries that are not using an index and are considered slow, you need to enable the logging of queries that do not use indexes. Based on your current configuration and the MySQL version you are using (5.5.8), you should add the `log-queries-not-using-indexes` parameter to your configuration. This will log queries that are slow and do not use indexes to the specified slow query log file. Here is the parameter you need to add:\n\n```plaintext\nlog-queries-not-using-indexes\n```\n\nSo, the list of parameters you need to add or ensure are set correctly in your `my.ini` file under the `[mysqld]` section is:\n\n```json\n[\"log-queries-not-using-indexes\"]\n```"}
