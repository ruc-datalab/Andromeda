{"res": "Based on the detailed error message and the replication issues you're experiencing with GTID-based replication in Percona MySQL 5.6, it seems that the problem might be related to the parallel execution of transactions which are not being applied in the correct order, leading to missing rows and subsequent errors like `HA_ERR_KEY_NOT_FOUND`.\n\nHere are some parameters and steps that might help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **slave_parallel_workers**: This parameter determines the number of threads that the slave will use to apply transactions in parallel. Since you mentioned that `sql_slave_parallel_workers` is set to `0`, it means that parallel replication is disabled. However, if it was previously enabled and then disabled, there might be transactions that were not applied correctly. Consider setting this back to a non-zero value if your workload and row-based replication format can benefit from parallel execution.\n\n2. **slave_preserve_commit_order**: When using parallel replication, enabling this parameter ensures that transactions are committed on the slave in the same order as they were on the master. This can help prevent issues where the slave applies transactions out of order, leading to inconsistencies.\n\n3. **gtid_mode**: Ensure that GTID mode is consistently enabled on both master and slave servers. This parameter should be set to `ON`.\n\n4. **enforce_gtid_consistency**: This parameter should be set to `ON` to ensure that all transactions are GTID-consistent.\n\n5. **slave_skip_errors**: Temporarily setting this to `all` or to the specific error code (`1032` in your case) can allow the slave to skip over the problematic transaction. However, use this with caution as it can lead to data inconsistencies.\n\n6. **sync_master_info**, **sync_relay_log**, **sync_relay_log_info**: These parameters should be set to `1` to ensure that the master and relay log information is synchronized to disk after each transaction. This can help prevent issues in crash recovery scenarios.\n\nSteps to resolve the replication issue:\n- Ensure that the `gtid_mode` and `enforce_gtid_consistency` are properly set and consistent across your replication topology.\n- If parallel replication was previously enabled and you suspect issues due to this, consider re-enabling `slave_parallel_workers` and setting `slave_preserve_commit_order` to `1`.\n- Stop the slave (`STOP SLAVE;`), set `slave_skip_errors` to `1032` or `all` temporarily, and then start the slave (`START SLAVE;`). Monitor the replication status closely.\n- Once the replication catches up and the errors are resolved, reset `slave_skip_errors` to its default or previous value to avoid skipping real errors in the future.\n- Consider performing a consistency check between the master and slave databases.\n\nGiven these considerations, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n```json\n[\n    \"slave_parallel_workers\",\n    \"slave_preserve_commit_order\",\n    \"gtid_mode\",\n    \"enforce_gtid_consistency\",\n    \"slave_skip_errors\",\n    \"sync_master_info\",\n    \"sync_relay_log\",\n    \"sync_relay_log_info\"\n]\n```"}
