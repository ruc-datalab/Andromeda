{"res": "Given the scenario described, where performance issues are primarily with INSERT and UPDATE queries in a master/master group replication setup, several MySQL parameters can be tuned to potentially improve performance. Here are some recommended parameters to consider:\n\n1. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter controls the balance between strict ACID compliance for commit operations and higher performance with less durability. Setting this to 2 can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file and flushing it to disk once per second without waiting for a transaction commit.\n\n2. **sync_binlog**: This parameter controls the binary log (used in replication). Setting it to 0 can increase performance by not flushing the binary log to disk on every commit. This setting, however, can lead to data loss in case of a crash.\n\n3. **innodb_doublewrite**: Disabling the doublewrite buffer (setting it to 0) can increase performance by reducing I/O overhead, but at the risk of potential data corruption in the event of a crash.\n\n4. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode**: Setting this to 2 (interleaved lock mode) can improve the performance of statements that use AUTO_INCREMENT columns by not requiring table-level AUTO-INC locks.\n\n5. **binlog_order_commits**: Setting this to OFF (0) can improve performance by allowing transactions to be committed in a different order than they are written to the binary log.\n\n6. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter can be increased to allow more concurrent threads within InnoDB, which might help performance depending on the workload and the server's CPU capabilities.\n\n7. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjusting these parameters can help optimize the I/O operations for InnoDB. Setting them higher can allow InnoDB to better utilize I/O capabilities of the storage.\n\n8. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Ensuring this is set to a sufficiently large value (typically up to 80% of total RAM) can improve performance by reducing disk I/O.\n\n9. **group_replication_flow_control_mode**: Adjusting this parameter can help manage flow control in group replication to optimize replication throughput.\n\n10. **group_replication_flow_control_applier_threshold** and **group_replication_flow_control_certifier_threshold**: These parameters can be tuned to manage the flow control thresholds for replication, which can help in balancing the load and improving the replication speed.\n\nThese parameters should be carefully tested in a staging environment before being applied to production, as incorrect settings can lead to data loss or other issues. Adjustments should be made based on specific workload characteristics and monitoring results."}
