{"res": "To enable logging of client IP addresses and timestamps for each query in MySQL, you can use the following parameters to configure the MySQL server to log general queries along with the necessary details:\n\n1. **`general_log`**: This parameter enables or disables the general query log that records every SQL statement received from clients. Set this to `ON` to enable logging.\n\n2. **`general_log_file`**: Specifies the file path where the general log will be written. You can set this to a specific file like `/var/log/mysql/mysql-general.log`.\n\n3. **`log_output`**: Determines the destination of log output. Setting this to `FILE` ensures that the logs are written to the file specified in `general_log_file`.\n\n4. **`log_timestamps`**: Controls the time zone of the timestamps in the log files. Set this to `SYSTEM` to use the system's local time.\n\nHere is the output list of parameters based on your requirements:\n\n```json\n['general_log', 'general_log_file', 'log_output', 'log_timestamps']\n```\n\nThese settings will help you track down the source of the queries by IP address and timestamp as recorded in the general log. Make sure to monitor the size of the log file because enabling general logging can generate large log files quickly, especially on a busy server. You might want to implement log rotation or only enable general logging for short periods when diagnosing issues."}
