{"res": "To address the issue you're encountering with the `mysqlbinlog` import where the `DateReceived` column cannot be null, you can consider adjusting the following MySQL parameters to ensure compatibility and proper handling of NULL values during the import process:\n\n1. **explicit_defaults_for_timestamp**: This parameter changes the default behavior for TIMESTAMP columns. If set to `ON`, TIMESTAMP columns not explicitly declared as NOT NULL accept NULL values. This might help in handling the NULL inserts from the binlog without changing the table structure.\n\n2. **sql_mode**: Adjusting the SQL mode can help manage how MySQL handles NULL values and other SQL standards. For instance, removing the `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` or `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` modes (if enabled) might prevent the server from rejecting NULL inserts to NOT NULL columns during the import process.\n\n3. **innodb_strict_mode**: If set to `OFF`, this parameter can relax the conditions for certain operations, allowing more flexibility during data import, although it's more commonly related to index creation and value truncation rather than NULL handling.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"explicit_defaults_for_timestamp\", \"sql_mode\", \"innodb_strict_mode\"]\n```\n\nThese settings can be adjusted temporarily for the duration of the import process and then reverted back to ensure the integrity and consistency of your database operations post-migration. Always ensure to test these changes in a staging environment before applying them in production to avoid unintended consequences."}
