{"res": "It seems like you are trying to set a MySQL system variable (`optimizer_search_depth`) within a SELECT statement, which is not the correct usage. System variables in MySQL are typically set using the `SET` command, either globally or for the session. Here's how you can correctly set the `optimizer_search_depth`:\n\n1. To set it globally (affects all sessions):\n   ```sql\n   SET GLOBAL optimizer_search_depth = 7;\n   ```\n\n2. To set it for the current session only:\n   ```sql\n   SET SESSION optimizer_search_depth = 7;\n   ```\n\nYou cannot use the `SET` command directly within a `SELECT` statement. If you need to retrieve the value of this parameter, you can use the `SELECT` statement like this:\n```sql\nSELECT @@optimizer_search_search_depth;\n```\n\nThis will return the current value of `optimizer_search_depth` for your session. If you want to check the global setting, you can use:\n```sql\nSELECT @@global.optimizer_search_depth;\n```\n\nHere's the output list format you requested, noting that the parameter in question is `optimizer_search_depth`:\n```json\n[\"optimizer_search_depth\"]\n```"}
