{"res": "Based on the provided MySQLTuner output and your server's configuration, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in order to optimize the performance of your MySQL server:\n\n1. **query_cache_size** and **query_cache_type**: The MySQLTuner output suggests that the query cache is disabled due to mutex contention, and its efficiency is 0.0%. It's recommended to disable the query cache by setting `query_cache_size` to 0 and `query_cache_type` to 0, especially in MySQL 5.7 where the query cache can be a bottleneck.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Currently set to 128M, which is quite low considering your server has 49.1G of physical memory. Increasing this value can significantly improve performance for InnoDB tables. A common recommendation is to set the buffer pool size to about 70-80% of your physical memory if MySQL is the primary service running on the server. Given your server's memory, setting it to around 24G-32G might be appropriate.\n\n3. **innodb_log_file_size**: This is set to 16M, which might be too small depending on your workload. Increasing this value can reduce the frequency of disk writes for the log buffer flush activity. A larger log file size will handle larger transactions more efficiently.\n\n4. **table_open_cache** and **open_files_limit**: These are set to 12000 and 24000, respectively. The MySQLTuner output shows a good hit rate, but if you have a large number of tables, increasing these values can reduce the number of disk opens.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size**: Set to 32. The MySQLTuner output shows a good hit rate (80%), but considering the number of connections, you might slightly increase this value to reduce the overhead of creating new threads.\n\n6. **max_connections**: Set to 500. You reached 66% of available connections. If you expect more concurrent connections, consider increasing this value.\n\n7. **join_buffer_size**: Not mentioned in your configuration, but if you have joins that are not using indexes, increasing this might help. However, your MySQLTuner output does not indicate issues with joins.\n\n8. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Both are set to 128M. Ensure these values are large enough to hold most temporary tables in memory to avoid on-disk temporary tables which are slower.\n\n9. **innodb_io_capacity**: Not mentioned in your configuration. Adjusting this value based on your disk's I/O capacity can help improve the InnoDB performance. The default is often too low for modern disks.\n\n10. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This is not mentioned, but if you have durability requirements that can tolerate a slight delay, setting this to 2 can improve write performance.\n\nHere's the list of parameters to adjust based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"open_files_limit\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\"\n]\n```"}
