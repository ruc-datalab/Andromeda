{"res": "To address the issue of reducing write operations to the SD card in your Spring Boot application using Hibernate/MySQL, you can consider the following database parameters and strategies:\n\n1. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: As you mentioned, setting this parameter to 2 will cause the log buffer to flush to disk every second, which is still too frequent. However, setting it to 0 will only flush once per minute, reducing the number of writes significantly. This parameter affects all tables, so it's a global change.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing the buffer pool size allows more data to be held in memory before being flushed to disk. This can reduce disk I/O by batching more writes together when they do occur.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing the log buffer size allows more transaction logs to be stored in memory before being written to disk. This can also help in reducing disk writes.\n\n4. **innodb_flush_neighbors**: Setting this parameter to 0 can reduce disk I/O on systems with spinning disks by not flushing neighboring pages, although it might not be as effective on an SD card.\n\n5. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjust these settings to match the I/O capabilities of your SD card. Lowering these values can reduce the I/O load on the disk.\n\n6. **sync_binlog**: Setting this to 0 can reduce the frequency of binary log flushes, which can help in environments where durability is less of a concern.\n\nGiven your specific need to reduce writes for a particular table, you might also consider application-level changes, such as batching inserts/updates at the application level and then committing them in bulk at set intervals. This approach would require some changes in your application logic but can be very effective in reducing write operations.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n  \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n  \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n  \"innodb_flush_neighbors\",\n  \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n  \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n  \"sync_binlog\"\n]\n```\n\nThese parameters should be adjusted carefully, monitoring the system for performance and stability changes. Additionally, consider regular backups and monitoring the health of the SD card to prevent data loss."}
