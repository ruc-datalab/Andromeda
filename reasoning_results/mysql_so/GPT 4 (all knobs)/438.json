{"res": "Based on the provided MySQL configuration and the symptoms of occasional crashes, there are several parameters that could be optimized to potentially improve the stability and performance of your MySQL server. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is set very low at 16M, especially for a site with your traffic. Increasing this could significantly improve performance for InnoDB tables by reducing disk I/O. Since you are using MyISAM as the default storage engine, consider switching to InnoDB if possible, as it handles concurrency and crash recovery better.\n\n2. **table_open_cache** and **table_cache**: These parameters determine the number of open tables for all threads. MySQL opens several tables for each client request. Increasing these values can improve performance when you have many tables.\n\n3. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter specifies how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many already there. Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.\n\n4. **max_connections**: This parameter is not listed in your configuration, but it's important to ensure it's set high enough to handle peak traffic without reaching connection limits, which could cause crashes or unavailable service.\n\n5. **query_cache_size**: You have this set to 1M, which is quite low. However, the query cache can sometimes reduce performance on highly dynamic sites like WordPress. Consider disabling the query cache by setting it to 0, especially since query cache efficiency in MySQL 5.5 is generally low.\n\n6. **key_buffer_size**: This is used for MyISAM tables and is set to 12M. Depending on the size of your indexes, increasing this might help, but since MyISAM locks the table for each write, consider moving to InnoDB if you face table-locking issues.\n\n7. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: These are crucial for InnoDB performance. The log file size determines how much data can be written to the log before a commit is required. The log buffer size holds data that has not yet been written to the log file. Both should be increased in a high-traffic environment.\n\n8. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. MySQL uses these for complex joins and other operations. If these tables exceed the specified size, MySQL will convert them to on-disk tables, which are much slower.\n\nGiven your current hosting plan and the traffic to your site, you might also consider upgrading your server to have more RAM and CPU resources. This would allow you to allocate more memory to MySQL, which is crucial for handling higher traffic and preventing crashes.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```"}
