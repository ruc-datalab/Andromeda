{"res": "Based on the provided information and the issues you're experiencing with your MySQL setup on your VPS, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your configuration:\n\n1. **max_connections**: You might want to increase this if you are frequently hitting the \"max user connections\" error, but be cautious of the memory usage.\n2. **join_buffer_size**: Increase this to reduce the number of joins performed without indexes, but ensure that you also work on optimizing queries to use indexes.\n3. **query_cache_size**: Increase this to a higher value to improve the cache hit rate, but be aware of the potential overhead.\n4. **sort_buffer_size**: Increase this as recommended to handle sorts more efficiently.\n5. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: Increase this to improve the efficiency of read operations that involve sorting and grouping.\n6. **table_open_cache**: You might want to increase this if you have a lot of tables and are seeing performance issues related to table opening.\n7. **thread_cache_size**: Adjusting this can help manage threads better and reduce overhead.\n8. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Ensure these are sized appropriately to handle your queries without too many temporary table on-disk creations.\n9. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: If you switch more tables to InnoDB, adjusting this parameter will be crucial for performance.\n10. **innodb_log_file_size**: Adjust this for better InnoDB logging performance.\n11. **innodb_file_per_table**: This is already set, which is good for managing InnoDB tables.\n12. **key_buffer_size**: Since you are using MyISAM as well, ensure this is adequately sized to improve MyISAM performance.\n\nHere's the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"max_connections\",\n  \"join_buffer_size\",\n  \"query_cache_size\",\n  \"sort_buffer_size\",\n  \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n  \"table_open_cache\",\n  \"thread_cache_size\",\n  \"tmp_table_size\",\n  \"max_heap_table_size\",\n  \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n  \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n  \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n  \"key_buffer_size\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help address some of the performance issues you're experiencing, but remember to monitor the changes to ensure they are having the desired effect without consuming too much of your system's resources."}
