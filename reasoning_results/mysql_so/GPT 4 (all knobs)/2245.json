{"res": "To address the issue of excluding \"FLUSH TABLES\" commands from being replicated in a master-master MySQL setup, you can use the following parameter:\n\n- `binlog_format`\n\nSetting the `binlog_format` to \"ROW\" ensures that only row-level changes are logged and replicated, not the statements like \"FLUSH TABLES\". This can help prevent the replication of administrative commands that could lead to deadlocks or other issues on the slave server.\n\nThus, the recommended parameter list is:\n\n```json\n['binlog_format']\n```"}
