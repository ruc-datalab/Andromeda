{"res": "The error message you're encountering is related to the MySQL server's binary logging settings, which are particularly important in replication setups. The error indicates that the function being created or used does not declare its deterministic nature or its relationship with SQL data, which is necessary for safe binary logging in replication scenarios.\n\nThe specific parameter you need to adjust to bypass this restriction is `log_bin_trust_function_creators`. Setting this parameter to `1` allows stored functions that do not have deterministic characteristics or contain data access statements to be logged in binary logs without strict checking. This is useful when you are sure about the safety of the functions regarding replication, but it should be used with caution as it can potentially lead to inconsistencies between master and slave databases if not properly managed.\n\nHere's the recommended parameter based on your description:\n\n```json\n[\"log_bin_trust_function_creators\"]\n```"}
