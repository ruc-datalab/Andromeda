{"res": "Based on your current configuration and the issues you're experiencing with memory and swap usage, here are some recommendations to optimize your MariaDB Galera cluster setup:\n\n1. **Disable Query Cache**: MariaDB's query cache can often lead to inefficiencies in multi-threaded environments like Galera, especially when the workload involves a lot of writes.\n\n2. **Adjust InnoDB Buffer Pool Size**: While having a large buffer pool is beneficial, setting it too high can lead to excessive swapping, especially if other processes on the server also require significant memory. Consider slightly reducing the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to leave more system memory for other processes and reduce swapping.\n\n3. **Reduce InnoDB Log File Size**: A very large log file size (`innodb_log_file_size`) might cause delays in crash recovery and can consume a lot of I/O resources when flushing logs to disk. Consider reducing this size to a more manageable value.\n\n4. **Optimize InnoDB Buffer Pool Instances**: The number of buffer pool instances (`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`) should ideally match the number of physical cores. If you have more instances than cores, it might lead to contention.\n\n5. **Adjust Max Connections**: If not all connections are utilized, consider reducing `max_connections` to free up resources.\n\n6. **Review Thread Cache Size**: A very high `thread_cache_size` can lead to unnecessary memory usage. Adjust this based on your typical workload.\n\n7. **Disable innodb_doublewrite**: Since you are using a Galera cluster which inherently provides data redundancy, you might consider disabling `innodb_doublewrite` to reduce disk I/O.\n\n8. **Adjust tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size**: Ensure these values are balanced to prevent excessive memory use for temporary tables.\n\n9. **Optimize Table Open Cache**: If you see that `table_open_cache` and `open_files_limit` are too high and not fully utilized, consider lowering these values to free up file descriptors and memory.\n\n10. **Disable innodb_stats_on_metadata**: This is already disabled in your configuration, which is good as it can improve performance by avoiding statistics updates on metadata statements.\n\n11. **Monitor and Adjust Swap Usage**: While disabling swap entirely isn't recommended as it serves as a buffer for emergency situations, excessive swapping indicates memory pressure. Monitor swap usage and consider adding more physical memory if needed.\n\n12. **InnoDB Flush Method**: Your setting of `O_DIRECT` is generally recommended to reduce I/O overhead.\n\nHere's the list of parameters you might consider adjusting based on the above recommendations:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_instances\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_doublewrite\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"open_files_limit\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help optimize the performance of your MariaDB Galera cluster and address the issues with memory and swap usage."}
