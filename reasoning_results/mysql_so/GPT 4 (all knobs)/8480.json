{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the FullText search in MySQL still returning results that include the word \"for\" despite your configuration changes might be due to the way MySQL handles stopwords and tokenization in its FullText search indexes. Here are a few parameters and considerations that might help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **innodb_ft_min_token_size**: This parameter sets the minimum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index for InnoDB tables. You've set this to 2, which is intended to include shorter words in the index.\n\n2. **ft_min_word_len**: Similar to `innodb_ft_min_token_size`, but this applies to MyISAM tables. Since you're using InnoDB, changes to this parameter will not affect your results.\n\n3. **ft_stopword_file**: Setting this to an empty string (`\"\"`) is supposed to disable the stopword filtering, allowing all words, including typically ignored stopwords like \"for\", to be indexed. However, ensure that the server was restarted after making this change as changes to FullText parameters often require a restart to take effect.\n\n4. **innodb_ft_enable_stopword**: This parameter controls whether InnoDB uses the built-in stopword list for FULLTEXT indexes. Setting this to `OFF` can explicitly disable stopword filtering.\n\nGiven your description, it seems like the changes might not have been fully applied or recognized by the server. Here are the steps and parameters you should verify or modify:\n\n- Ensure that the MySQL server was restarted after making changes to the `ft_stopword_file` and `innodb_ft_min_token_size`.\n- Check if `innodb_ft_enable_stopword` is set to `OFF` to ensure that stopwords are not being used at all.\n- Rebuild the FULLTEXT index on your table after making these changes. Changes to FullText configuration do not affect existing indexes until they are rebuilt. You can rebuild the index using `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name, ADD FULLTEXT index_name(column_name);`\n\nHere's the list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_ft_min_token_size\",\n    \"ft_stopword_file\",\n    \"innodb_ft_enable_stopword\"\n]\n```\n\nMake sure to apply these settings, restart your MySQL server, and rebuild your FULLTEXT indexes to see if the issue persists."}
