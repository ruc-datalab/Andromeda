{"res": "To log queries that generate temporary files in MySQL, you can use the following parameters:\n\n1. `log_output` - This parameter determines the destination of the log output. Set it to 'FILE' to ensure that logs are written to files.\n2. `slow_query_log` - Enable this to log queries that take longer than a specified amount of time, which often includes queries that involve on-disk temporary tables.\n3. `slow_query_log_file` - Specifies the file where slow queries are logged.\n4. `long_query_time` - Set this to a low value to capture most queries. Queries that take longer than this value in seconds are considered slow.\n5. `min_examined_row_limit` - Use this to avoid logging queries that examine fewer rows than the specified limit.\n6. `log_queries_not_using_indexes` - Enable this to log queries that do not utilize indexes. These queries might be creating on-disk temporary tables.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters, you can effectively log queries that are likely to be creating temporary disk files, which can then be analyzed for optimization.\n\nOutputting the list as requested:\n\n```json\n['log_output', 'slow_query_log', 'slow_query_log_file', 'long_query_time', 'min_examined_row_limit', 'log_queries_not_using_indexes']\n```"}
