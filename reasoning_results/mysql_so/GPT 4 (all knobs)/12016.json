{"res": "Based on your description of MySQL consuming a significant amount of memory on a fresh XAMPP installation, you might be interested in parameters that can help manage or reduce memory usage. Here are some relevant MySQL configuration parameters that could be adjusted to potentially lower the memory footprint:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter determines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. Reducing this size can decrease memory usage, but may affect performance.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter specifies the size of the buffer used for index blocks for MyISAM tables. Adjusting this size can influence memory usage if you have MyISAM tables.\n\n3. **query_cache_size** - If enabled, this parameter sets the amount of memory allocated for caching query results. Note that the query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0.\n\n4. **thread_stack** - This is the stack size for each thread. Reducing it might save some memory, but it needs to be sufficient for the operations performed by each thread.\n\n5. **table_definition_cache** and **table_open_cache** - These parameters control the number of table definitions and table files that MySQL caches in memory. Lowering these values can reduce memory usage but might impact performance if tables are opened and closed frequently.\n\n6. **max_connections** - This parameter determines the maximum number of simultaneous client connections. Reducing this number can lower the memory required for connection management.\n\n7. **innodb_log_buffer_size** - This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A smaller size might reduce memory usage but could impact performance during heavy write loads.\n\n8. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters specify the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables and heap tables, respectively. Adjusting these can control the memory usage of temporary tables.\n\nHere is the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"thread_stack\",\n    \"table_definition_cache\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should be done cautiously, considering the trade-offs between memory usage and database performance. Always test changes in a development environment before applying them to production."}
