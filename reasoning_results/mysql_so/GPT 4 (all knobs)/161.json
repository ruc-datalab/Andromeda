{"res": "Based on the description of your issue, it seems that the `auto_increment_increment` setting is not being applied as expected on your server, despite it working correctly on your local machine. This could be due to several reasons, such as session-specific settings, global settings being overridden, or replication configurations that might affect this behavior. Here are some parameters and areas you might want to check:\n\n1. **auto_increment_increment** - This is the parameter you are already trying to adjust. It controls the incrementation step for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value.\n\n2. **auto_increment_offset** - This parameter determines the starting point for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` value. Sometimes, it's used in replication setups to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **binlog_format** - If your server is part of a replication setup, the binary logging format might influence how `AUTO_INCREMENT` values are handled, especially in statement-based replication.\n\n4. **log_bin** - Check if binary logging is enabled, as it can also interact with how `AUTO_INCREMENT` values are replicated and managed across servers.\n\n5. **replication settings** - If your server is a replica, there might be specific replication configurations that affect `AUTO_INCREMENT` handling. This includes settings like `--replicate-auto-increment-variables`.\n\n6. **session vs. global variables** - Ensure that you are setting the `auto_increment_increment` globally if that's the intended scope. Use `SET GLOBAL auto_increment_increment=1;` instead of `SET @@auto_increment_increment=1;` which sets the session-specific value.\n\nHere's the list of parameters you might want to review or adjust based on the above discussion:\n\n```json\n['auto_increment_increment', 'auto_increment_offset', 'binlog_format', 'log_bin']\n```\n\nMake sure to check the global and session values for these parameters and consider any replication or binary logging aspects that might be influencing the behavior."}
