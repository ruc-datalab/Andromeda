{"res": "To address the issue where tables are being created with the MyISAM engine instead of InnoDB, and considering the inability to select InnoDB from the engine dropdown in HeidiSQL, you may need to check and adjust the following MySQL server parameters:\n\n1. **`default_storage_engine`**: This parameter sets the default storage engine for new tables if the storage engine is not specified explicitly during table creation. Setting this to 'InnoDB' should ensure that new tables are created with InnoDB unless specified otherwise.\n\n2. **`disabled_storage_engines`**: This parameter can be used to disable certain storage engines in the MySQL server. If InnoDB is mistakenly listed here, it would prevent its selection and usage.\n\nHere is the list of parameters that you should check and configure appropriately:\n\n```json\n['default_storage_engine', 'disabled_storage_engines']\n```"}
