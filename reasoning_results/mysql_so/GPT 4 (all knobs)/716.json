{"res": "From the description and the code provided, it seems the main issue is related to setting the locale for date and time formatting in MySQL queries from a C# application. The parameter that directly influences this in MySQL is `lc_time_names`. This parameter sets the locale for the representation of months and day names in date functions.\n\nIn your C# application, you are setting `lc_time_names` for the MySQL session right before executing queries. However, it seems like the setting might not be persisting across different database connections or commands within the same session. This could be due to how connections are managed in your application or the specifics of how the ODBC driver handles session-specific settings.\n\nTo ensure that the `lc_time_names` setting is applied correctly, you might need to ensure that it is set in the same connection and immediately before the query that requires the locale setting, without closing the connection or opening a new one. If the application uses multiple connections or if connections are pooled and reused, each connection might need to have `lc_time_names` set explicitly.\n\nHere are the relevant parameters based on your scenario:\n\n1. **lc_time_names** - This parameter is used to set the locale for displaying month names and day names in the output of date functions in MySQL.\n\nGiven the nature of your problem, focusing on the correct and consistent application of this setting in your database queries from the C# application is crucial. Ensure that each query session that requires localized date formatting has this parameter set appropriately right before the query execution.\n\nOutput list format as requested:\n```json\n[\"lc_time_names\"]\n```"}
