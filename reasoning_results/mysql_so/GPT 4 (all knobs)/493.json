{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where you are experiencing issues with large result sets and complex queries in Laravel using PDO on a SQL Server, the problem likely relates to resource limits and query execution settings. Here are some relevant parameters that could potentially help address the issue:\n\n1. `max_allowed_packet` - Increases the maximum packet size for network communication. Large queries might exceed the default packet size.\n2. `innodb_buffer_pool_size` - Increases the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. A larger buffer pool can accommodate more data, reducing disk I/O.\n3. `innodb_log_file_size` - Increases the size of the log file, which can help with the performance of large transactions.\n4. `max_connections` - Increases the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the server, which might be necessary if the server is handling many connections at the same time.\n5. `connect_timeout` - Increases the time allowed for a connection to the server to be established, which might help if connections are timing out due to server load.\n6. `wait_timeout` - Increases the time that the server waits for activity on a non-interactive connection before closing it, which can be useful if long queries are causing timeouts.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted in your database configuration to potentially help with handling larger datasets and more complex queries without running into errors.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"connect_timeout\",\n    \"wait_timeout\"\n]\n```"}
