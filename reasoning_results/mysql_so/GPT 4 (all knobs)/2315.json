{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the problem and the settings provided, here are some MySQL parameters that could be relevant to tuning the performance issues described, especially concerning the fulltext index updates and the semaphore waits:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is already set to a large value (53G), which is generally good, but ensure it's appropriately sized for the system's total memory and the database's workload.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: Set to 25G, which is quite large. This could potentially lead to performance issues during crash recovery but is unlikely the cause of the semaphore waits. However, it's worth reviewing if this size is optimal based on the transaction volume.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: At 4M, this might be too small depending on the transaction size during the index updates. Increasing this might help reduce disk I/O by holding more log information in memory before flushing to disk.\n\n4. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Set to 0, which improves performance but at the cost of durability. This setting is okay for some workloads but be aware of the durability implications.\n\n5. **innodb_adaptive_hash_index**: You've disabled this, which seems to have helped. This setting can impact performance depending on the workload, and it's good that you've found some improvement here.\n\n6. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter might need tuning if there are too many threads contending for resources, leading to semaphore waits.\n\n7. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings should be configured based on the I/O capability of the storage system. They can significantly affect how background I/O is done for flushing and merging.\n\n8. **innodb_flush_neighbors**: If set to 1, InnoDB tries to flush neighbor pages from the buffer pool, which can sometimes slow down the system if the disk subsystem is not fast enough. Setting it to 0 might help in systems with SSD storage.\n\n9. **innodb_purge_threads**: Increasing the number of purge threads can help in environments where large volumes of data are deleted, which seems relevant given the dropping and adding of indexes.\n\n10. **innodb_change_buffer_max_size**: Since you are frequently updating indexes, tuning this parameter might help. It controls the maximum size of the change buffer, which caches changes to secondary index entries.\n\n11. **innodb_sort_buffer_size**: This parameter is used during the creation of indexes. If the default is not sufficient, increasing it might help speed up index creation.\n\n12. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout**: If transactions are waiting too long for locks due to high concurrency or large updates, consider adjusting this timeout.\n\nGiven the symptoms described, especially the semaphore waits and the crash due to a long semaphore wait, it's crucial to ensure that the system is not over-committed in terms of memory and I/O resources. Monitoring tools can help identify bottlenecks in CPU, memory, disk I/O, and MySQL's internal metrics.\n\nHere's the output list format as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_adaptive_hash_index\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_flush_neighbors\",\n    \"innodb_purge_threads\",\n    \"innodb_change_buffer_max_size\",\n    \"innodb_sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_lock_wait_timeout\"\n]\n```"}
