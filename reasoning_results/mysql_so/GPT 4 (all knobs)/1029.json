{"res": "The parameters you're asking about relate to the internal workings of InnoDB, specifically how it handles transaction and locking information. However, MySQL does not provide a direct configuration parameter to dump the contents of the INNODB_TRX, INNODB_LOCKS, and INNODB_LOCK_WAITS tables directly into a file through the MySQL configuration itself.\n\nThese tables are part of the Information Schema and are intended for real-time inspection rather than logging to a file via MySQL configuration parameters. If you need to capture this data periodically for analysis, you would typically do this with an external script or tool that queries these tables and writes the results to a file.\n\nHowever, for completeness, here are related parameters that influence general logging and might be tangentially related to capturing such data, though not directly writing these specific tables to a file:\n\n```plaintext\n['general_log', 'general_log_file', 'log_output']\n```\n\nThese parameters control the general query log in MySQL, where `general_log` enables or disables the log, `general_log_file` specifies the log file name, and `log_output` determines the output destination (file, table, or none). You could potentially enable general logging to capture all queries, including those selecting from the InnoDB transaction and locking tables, but this would not exclusively log just the transaction and locking information and would include all queries processed by the server."}
