{"res": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue with connecting to the MySQL database from Python is related to SSL configuration, similar to the JavaScript scenario where specifying `ssl: \"Amazon RDS\"` was necessary. Since the Python mysql.connector library also supports SSL connections, you should configure your Python code to use SSL when connecting to the AWS RDS instance.\n\nHere are the parameters you should consider:\n\n1. **`ssl_ca`**: The path to a file that contains a list of trusted SSL CAs. AWS RDS provides a downloadable root certificate that you can use.\n2. **`ssl_cert`**: The path to the SSL certificate file (if client certification is required by the server).\n3. **`ssl_key`**: The path to the SSL key file (if client certification is required by the server).\n4. **`ssl_cipher`**: Specifies the SSL cipher to use.\n\nYou can modify your Python code to include these SSL parameters. Here's an example of how you might configure it:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nimport datetime\n\nthinknode = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host=\"example.com\",\n    user=\"cwaugh\",\n    passwd=\"********\",\n    db=\"mydb\",\n    ssl_ca=\"/path/to/aws-rds-ca-cert.pem\",  # Path to the AWS RDS root CA certificate\n    ssl_disabled=False  # Ensure SSL is not disabled\n)\n```\n\nMake sure to download the AWS RDS root CA certificate from the AWS documentation and specify the correct path in `ssl_ca`. If additional client certificates are required (not typical for most configurations), you would also specify `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key`.\n\nTherefore, the parameters you need to consider are:\n\n```plaintext\n['ssl_ca', 'ssl_cert', 'ssl_key', 'ssl_cipher']\n```"}
