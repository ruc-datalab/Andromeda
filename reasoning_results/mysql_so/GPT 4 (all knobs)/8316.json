{"res": "The discrepancy in the write statistics you're observing can be attributed to several factors related to how MySQL and the InnoDB storage engine handle data under the hood. Here are some parameters and concepts that might explain the behavior:\n\n1. **Double Write Buffer**: InnoDB uses a doublewrite buffer to achieve atomic writes, which can cause the data to be written twice initially - once to the doublewrite buffer and once to the actual data file.\n\n2. **Redo Log (Transaction Log)**: InnoDB logs each change in the redo log before the actual data files are modified for crash recovery purposes. This can account for additional write overhead.\n\n3. **Binary Log**: If binary logging is enabled (for replication or backup purposes), each transaction is also written to the binary log, which can further multiply the amount of data written.\n\n4. **Change Buffer**: InnoDB uses a change buffer for secondary index updates, which can result in less immediate disk I/O at the expense of more I/O later when the buffer is merged into the actual index structure.\n\n5. **Adaptive Hash Index**: This feature can increase write operations due to adjustments in the adaptive hash index structures as data changes.\n\n6. **Undo Logs**: Modifications to data also generate undo logs, which are used to roll back transactions and during MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) to provide transaction isolation.\n\nGiven these factors, the parameters that might be relevant to tuning or understanding the behavior include:\n\n- `innodb_doublewrite`: Controls the double write buffer, which helps in crash recovery.\n- `innodb_log_file_size` and `innodb_log_files_in_group`: Determine the size of the redo logs.\n- `sync_binlog`: Controls the synchronization of the binary log to disk.\n- `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`: Determines the balance between ACID compliance and performance for log flushing.\n- `innodb_change_buffering`: Controls the operations buffered in the change buffer.\n- `innodb_adaptive_hash_index`: Enables or disables the adaptive hash index.\n\nTo address the \"cancelled writes,\" which might be related to how InnoDB and the filesystem interact (e.g., write combining, partial page writes), you might consider:\n\n- `innodb_flush_neighbors`: Controls whether or not InnoDB flushes neighbors of a page.\n- `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max`: These settings can be adjusted based on the I/O capacity of your system to optimize I/O utilization.\n\nGiven your scenario, you might want to review and possibly adjust these parameters:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"innodb_doublewrite\",\n  \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n  \"innodb_log_files_in_group\",\n  \"sync_binlog\",\n  \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n  \"innodb_change_buffering\",\n  \"innodb_adaptive_hash_index\",\n  \"innodb_flush_neighbors\",\n  \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n  \"innodb_io_capacity_max\"\n]\n```\n\nThese parameters can help you manage and potentially reduce the I/O overhead observed, depending on your specific workload and system capabilities."}
