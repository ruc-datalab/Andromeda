{"res": "Based on the scenario you've described, it seems that the issue is not directly related to database parameters that need to be set or adjusted, but rather with the SQL syntax or the method used for encryption and decryption. The parameters you've provided are mostly related to server configuration and do not directly influence the behavior of SQL functions like `AES_ENCRYPT` or `AES_DECRYPT`.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for parameters that could potentially impact the behavior of encryption functions or the handling of binary and encrypted data, you might consider looking at parameters related to character sets and collations, as improper settings here might affect how binary data is handled. Here are a few parameters that could be relevant, although they might not directly solve the issue:\n\n1. `character_set_connection`\n2. `character_set_database`\n3. `character_set_server`\n4. `collation_connection`\n5. `collation_database`\n6. `collation_server`\n\nThese parameters ensure that the server handles character encoding correctly, which is crucial when dealing with binary data such as encrypted information. Misconfiguration might lead to issues in how binary data is stored, retrieved, or compared.\n\nIf you are experiencing issues with `NULL` results or unexpected data types (like BLOBs), it's also worth checking:\n\n- The data type and size of the columns storing encrypted data to ensure they are appropriate for holding binary data (e.g., using `BLOB` or `VARBINARY` instead of `VARCHAR`).\n- The correctness of the encryption and decryption keys and methods used in your SQL queries.\n- Whether the initialization vector (IV) is correctly applied in both encryption and decryption processes.\n\nHere is a revised SQL example to ensure proper usage of AES encryption functions:\n\n```sql\n-- Assuming Encrypted_ID is stored as a binary data type\nSELECT CAST(AES_DECRYPT(Encrypted_ID, 'Key', InitializationVector_iv) AS CHAR) AS DecryptedValue\nFROM MyTable;\n```\n\nMake sure that:\n- 'Key' and `InitializationVector_iv` are correctly specified and consistent in length and content as expected by the AES algorithm.\n- The `Encrypted_ID` column should be of a binary type suitable for storing encrypted data.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, consider reviewing the encryption logic and ensuring that the data is being stored and retrieved correctly."}
