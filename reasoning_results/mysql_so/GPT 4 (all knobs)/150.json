{"res": "Based on your scenario, where you are dealing with time zones in MySQL and PHP, the key parameters and settings to consider primarily revolve around how MySQL handles time zones and timestamps. Here are the relevant MySQL parameters:\n\n1. **`time_zone`**: This parameter sets the time zone for the MySQL server. It's crucial for ensuring that the server operates in the correct time zone, which affects how `TIMESTAMP` values are stored and retrieved.\n\n2. **`timestamp`**: This isn't a parameter but a data type in MySQL. Understanding how MySQL handles `TIMESTAMP` data types is essential since they are converted from the current time zone to UTC for storage and back to the current time zone for retrieval.\n\n3. **`default-time-zone`**: This global variable can be set at server startup to define the default server time zone. This setting is important if you want all connections to the MySQL server to use a specific time zone by default.\n\n4. **`init_connect`**: This parameter can be used to set a session-level command that runs for each new connection. For example, setting the time zone for each session based on the user or application requirements.\n\nGiven your description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misconfiguration in how time zones are handled between PHP and MySQL. MySQL does not store the UTC offset with the `TIMESTAMP` data type; it converts `TIMESTAMP` values to UTC for storage and back to the current time zone of the MySQL server (or the session if set differently) upon retrieval. If PHP scripts are setting different time zones (`America/New_York` for one and using the server default `America/Los_Angeles` for another), and if MySQL's time zone setting (`time_zone`) is not explicitly set to match these or handled dynamically per session, discrepancies like the one you observed can occur.\n\nTo address your issue, consider:\n\n- Ensuring that MySQL's `time_zone` setting aligns with your needs or handling time zone settings dynamically per session using `init_connect`.\n- Verifying that PHP correctly handles time zone settings when reading from or writing to the database.\n\nHere's the output list of relevant MySQL parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n['time_zone', 'timestamp', 'default-time-zone', 'init_connect']\n```"}
