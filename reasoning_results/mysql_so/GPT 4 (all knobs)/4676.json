{"res": "Based on the provided PL/SQL block and the issue described, it seems that the problem is not directly related to database parameters that need tuning or configuration. Instead, the issue appears to be with the PL/SQL code itself, particularly in how data is being fetched and used within the loops.\n\nThe problem described is that the `dbms_output.put_line(v_total_sum || '---');` does not output any data. This could be due to the way `v_total_sum` is being handled in the cursor loop. The `SELECT` statement within the cursor loop is using `INTO` which is not necessary and incorrect in this context because the loop is already fetching the data into `loop_emp`.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the inner loop part of your PL/SQL block:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN\n    FOR loop_emp IN (SELECT TOTAL_SUM FROM TABLE_TEMP)\n    LOOP\n        dbms_output.put_line(to_char(sysdate, 'mi:ss') ||'--- '|| loop_emp.TOTAL_SUM || '-TEST--');\n    END LOOP;\nEND;\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n- Removed the `INTO v_total_sum` from the `SELECT` statement in the cursor FOR loop. The `FOR loop_emp IN` already fetches each `TOTAL_SUM` into `loop_emp.TOTAL_SUM`.\n- Changed the `dbms_output.put_line` to use `loop_emp.TOTAL_SUM` directly.\n\nRegarding database parameters, since the issue is more about the PL/SQL code logic rather than database performance or behavior, adjusting parameters might not resolve the issue. However, if you are looking for general improvements or relevant parameters that could indirectly affect the performance of such scripts, you might consider parameters related to PL/SQL execution, such as:\n\n- `PLSQL_CODE_TYPE`: This parameter determines whether PL/SQL library units are stored using native code or interpreted code. Setting it to `NATIVE` might improve performance.\n- `PLSQL_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL`: This parameter controls the optimization level for PL/SQL compilation. Higher levels increase the optimization effort.\n- `DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE`: Ensure that the buffer size is sufficient to capture all outputs if the default is not enough.\n\nSince none of these directly relate to the issue at hand but are more about optimizing PL/SQL execution, the list of parameters specifically for the described issue would be empty:\n\n```json\n[]\n```\n\nFocus on correcting the PL/SQL code as shown above to resolve the issue with `dbms_output.put_line`."}
