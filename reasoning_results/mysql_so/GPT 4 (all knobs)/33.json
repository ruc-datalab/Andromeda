{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where a MySQL Docker container's memory usage increases significantly during an \"optimize table\" operation and then returns to normal after a restart, several MySQL configuration parameters could be relevant to understanding and potentially mitigating this behavior. Here are the parameters that might be most pertinent:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. If the buffer pool is too small, it might not be able to efficiently handle the operations on the large table.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: This is the size of each log file in a log group. A larger log file size might allow for more efficient handling of large transactions that could occur during table optimizations.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. During intensive write operations like an \"optimize table\", a larger log buffer might help in handling bursts of log data.\n\n4. **innodb_sort_buffer_size**: During the \"optimize table\" operation, sorting may be involved, especially if the table has many indexes. This parameter controls the size of the buffer that is allocated for each sort operation.\n\n5. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. \"Optimize table\" might use temporary tables, and if these are too small, MySQL might have to create on-disk temporary tables, which are slower.\n\n6. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings affect the I/O capacity that InnoDB assumes is available. Adjusting these might help in managing how I/O is handled during operations like \"optimize table\".\n\n7. **innodb_adaptive_hash_index**: This parameter enables or disables the adaptive hash index feature, which can affect memory usage and performance. Disabling it might reduce memory usage but could impact performance.\n\n8. **innodb_change_buffering**: This controls the operations allowed in the change buffer, which temporarily stores changes to secondary index pages, reducing I/O for DML operations. Adjusting this might impact the performance and efficiency of index-related operations during \"optimize table\".\n\nGiven the scenario, these parameters could be adjusted to see if they mitigate the high memory usage during the \"optimize table\" operation. However, changes should be tested in a controlled environment before being applied in production. Here's the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_adaptive_hash_index\",\n    \"innodb_change_buffering\"\n]\n```"}
