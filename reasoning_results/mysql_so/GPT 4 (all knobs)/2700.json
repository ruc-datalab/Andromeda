{"res": "To improve the performance of the OPTIMIZE statement on large MyISAM tables, particularly when the status shows \"Repair by sorting\", you can consider adjusting the following parameters:\n\n1. **myisam_sort_buffer_size** - This parameter determines the size of the buffer that is allocated during the sort operations while repairing or optimizing MyISAM tables. Increasing this buffer size can help speed up the sorting process during the OPTIMIZE operation.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size** - Although primarily used for caching MyISAM indexes, ensuring this is adequately sized ensures that index blocks are kept in memory, which might indirectly benefit the performance of index re-creation during the OPTIMIZE operation.\n\n3. **read_buffer_size** and **write_buffer_size** - These parameters control the size of the buffers that MySQL uses for reading from and writing to MyISAM tables. Adjusting these might help in speeding up the read and write operations during the sorting and optimization process.\n\n4. **sort_buffer_size** - While this parameter is more commonly associated with the sorting operations for queries, it's generally for sorting within SELECT queries. However, ensuring it is not set too low is also beneficial as it could potentially impact overall server sorting performance.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\"myisam_sort_buffer_size\", \"key_buffer_size\", \"read_buffer_size\", \"write_buffer_size\", \"sort_buffer_size\"]\n```"}
