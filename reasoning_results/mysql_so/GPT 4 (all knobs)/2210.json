{"res": "Based on the scenario described, it appears that the connection to the PostgreSQL database is indeed using SSL/TLS, as indicated by the log entry stating \"SSL enabled (protocol=TLSv1.3, cipher=TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits=256, compression=off).\" This suggests that the connection is secure and encrypted using TLS v1.3 with a strong cipher suite.\n\nThe fact that the `pg_restore` command succeeded without explicitly setting `PGSSLMODE` to `require` in the command line or configuration suggests that the server (`mypg.postgres.database.azure.com`) is configured to require SSL connections by default. This is further supported by the parameter `require_secure_transport = \"on\"` which enforces that all connections to the database server must use secure transport (i.e., SSL/TLS).\n\nGiven this information, the relevant parameters that are likely configured to enforce and support this behavior include:\n\n1. `require_secure_transport` - Enforces the requirement for secure connections.\n2. `ssl_ca` - The file path to the SSL certificate authority file.\n3. `ssl_cert` - The file path to the server SSL certificate.\n4. `ssl_key` - The file path to the server SSL private key.\n5. `ssl_cipher` - Specifies the list of allowable ciphers for SSL encryption.\n\nThese parameters ensure that the database server only allows connections that are securely encrypted, complying with best practices for data security.\n\nTherefore, the output list of parameters relevant to the scenario described would be:\n\n```json\n[\"require_secure_transport\", \"ssl_ca\", \"ssl_cert\", \"ssl_key\", \"ssl_cipher\"]\n```"}
