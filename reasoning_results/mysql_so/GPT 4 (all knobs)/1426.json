{"res": "Based on the error description you provided, it seems that your database is blocking connections due to too many connection errors. This is typically managed by the `max_connect_errors` parameter in MySQL, which controls how many connection errors are allowed before the host is blocked.\n\nSince you mentioned changing the host from `%` to a specific IP address for security reasons, it's possible that incorrect attempts to connect (perhaps with wrong credentials or configurations) have caused the server to reach the limit set by `max_connect_errors`.\n\nHere are the parameters you might consider adjusting to resolve or investigate this issue:\n\n1. **max_connect_errors** - Increase this value to allow more connection errors before blocking. This can help if the issue is due to transient network problems or intermittent issues during your configuration changes.\n2. **skip_name_resolve** - If you are using IP addresses, you might want to disable DNS hostname resolution to speed up connection times and avoid issues related to DNS resolution.\n3. **log_warnings** - Increase the verbosity of warning logging to get more information about connection errors, which can help in diagnosing the issue.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\"max_connect_errors\", \"skip_name_resolve\", \"log_warnings\"]\n```"}
