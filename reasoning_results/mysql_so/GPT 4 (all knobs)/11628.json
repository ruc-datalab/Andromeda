{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the `keyring_file` plugin on your MySQL server setup on WAMP64 is related to file permissions, specifically Errcode 13, which indicates a permission denied error. This error typically arises when the MySQL service user does not have the necessary permissions to access the specified file or directory.\n\nGiven the details you've provided, here are a few parameters and settings to consider:\n\n1. **keyring_file_data** - This parameter specifies the location of the keyring file where the keys are stored. Ensure that the path is correct and accessible by the MySQL service user.\n\n2. **plugin_dir** - This parameter specifies the directory where plugins are located. Verify that this path is correct and that the MySQL service user has read and execute permissions on this directory.\n\nSince you've mentioned that the MySQL service runs with Local System permissions, it should typically have sufficient privileges to access most directories and files on the system. However, there might be specific security policies or attributes set on the plugin directory or the keyring file itself that are preventing access.\n\nHere are the steps and checks you should perform:\n\n- **Check File and Folder Permissions**: Ensure that the `C:/wamp64/bin/mysql/mysql5.7.19/lib/plugin/` directory and the `keyring_file.dll` file have the appropriate permissions. The Local System account should have full control over these.\n\n- **File Security Attributes**: Sometimes, files downloaded from the Internet are blocked by Windows security. Right-click the DLL file, select Properties, and check if there's an Unblock button in the General tab. If there is, click it, apply the changes, and restart the MySQL service.\n\n- **Path Specification**: Ensure that the path specified in the `keyring_file_data` parameter uses double backslashes `\\\\` or forward slashes `/` as directory separators in Windows environments.\n\n- **Service User**: Although running as Local System should generally not face permissions issues, you might consider testing with a different user account that has administrative privileges to rule out any specific restrictions on the Local System account.\n\nGiven these considerations, the parameters to focus on are:\n```json\n[\"keyring_file_data\", \"plugin_dir\"]\n```\n\nEnsure these parameters are correctly set and that environmental conditions (like permissions and security policies) support their effective use. If the issue persists after verifying and adjusting these settings, consider examining Windows Event Logs or MySQL error logs for more specific diagnostic messages that might indicate other underlying issues."}
