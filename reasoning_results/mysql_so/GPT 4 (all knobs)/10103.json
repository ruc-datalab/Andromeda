{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where you are encountering SSL connection issues between your SpringBoot application and a PostgreSQL server configured with SSL, the relevant parameters to focus on would primarily involve SSL configurations on both the PostgreSQL server and within your SpringBoot application. Here are the parameters that are likely relevant to your situation:\n\n1. **ssl**: This parameter in `postgresql.conf` enables SSL connections. It is already set to 'on' as per your description.\n\n2. **ssl_ciphers**: This parameter in `postgresql.conf` specifies the list of allowed SSL ciphers. You have it set to 'TLSv1.2', which should be compatible with your SpringBoot settings.\n\n3. **hostssl**: This line in `pg_hba.conf` specifies that connections on certain host lines must use SSL. Your configuration seems correct, but ensure that the IP and method (`md5`) match the client's capabilities and requirements.\n\nFrom the SpringBoot side, the relevant configurations in your `application.yml` that pertain to SSL are:\n\n4. **ssl.enabled**: This enables SSL in your SpringBoot application. It's set to true in your configuration.\n\n5. **key-store**: This specifies the path to the keystore file containing your server certificate and private key.\n\n6. **key-store-password**: This is the password for accessing the keystore.\n\n7. **key-store-type**: This specifies the type of keystore, which is JKS in your case.\n\n8. **key-alias**: This specifies the alias that identifies the key in the keystore.\n\n9. **trust-store**: This would be relevant if specified, as it contains certificates of the trusted CA.\n\n10. **protocol**: This specifies the SSL protocol version, which is TLS in your configuration.\n\n11. **ciphers**: This specifies the SSL cipher suites that are enabled.\n\nGiven the error messages you are seeing, particularly the \"PKIX path building failed\" error, it suggests there might be an issue with how the certificates are set up or trusted between your SpringBoot application and the PostgreSQL server. Ensure that:\n\n- The PostgreSQL server's certificate is signed by a CA that is trusted by the keystore in your SpringBoot application.\n- The CA's certificate is included in the truststore of your SpringBoot application if using a separate truststore.\n- The alias and certificates are correctly configured and match between your SpringBoot and PostgreSQL settings.\n\nThese configurations and checks should help resolve the SSL connection issues you are experiencing."}
