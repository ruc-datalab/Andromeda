{"res": "In response to the error you're encountering with the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command, which indicates that the transaction required more storage than allowed by the `max_binlog_cache_size`, you have a couple of options to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Increase the `max_binlog_cache_size`**: This parameter sets the size in bytes of the cache to hold changes to the binary log during a transaction. If transactions involve BLOB data or large rows, increasing this size can help.\n\n2. **Split the load file**: If increasing the `max_binlog_cache_size` is not feasible or does not resolve the issue, consider splitting your large data file into smaller chunks. This can help manage the memory usage and avoid hitting the limit.\n\nHere are the parameters you should consider adjusting based on your situation:\n\n```json\n[\"max_binlog_cache_size\"]\n```\n\nTo modify the `max_binlog_cache_size`, you can set it in your MySQL server's configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini` under the `[mysqld]` section) or dynamically via the MySQL command line if your user has the necessary privileges:\n\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL max_binlog_cache_size = <new_size>;\n```\n\nReplace `<new_size>` with the desired cache size in bytes. Make sure to choose a size that fits your server's memory capacity. After making changes to the configuration file, you will need to restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect."}
