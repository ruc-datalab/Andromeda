{"res": "To address the issue of the continuously increasing size of the `ibtmp1` file in MySQL 5.7 without restarting the server, you can adjust the following parameters:\n\n- `innodb_temp_data_file_path`: This parameter allows you to specify the file path for the temporary data file, including its size and autoextend properties. Adjusting this might help manage how the temporary data file grows.\n- `innodb_max_purge_lag`: This parameter can indirectly affect the size of the temporary tablespace by controlling how much undo logging is kept before a purge operation is triggered, potentially reducing the amount of temporary data stored.\n- `innodb_purge_batch_size`: This parameter determines the number of pages purged in each batch operation. Increasing this value might help in faster purging of undo logs that can indirectly affect the size of `ibtmp1`.\n\nThese parameters can help manage the growth of the `ibtmp1` file indirectly by controlling related operations, although direct resizing or deletion without a restart is not typically supported.\n\n```json\n['innodb_temp_data_file_path', 'innodb_max_purge_lag', 'innodb_purge_batch_size']\n```"}
