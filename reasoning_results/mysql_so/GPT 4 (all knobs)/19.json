{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the MySQL server is experiencing a high number of TCP connections in the TIME_WAIT state, it's important to consider parameters that can help manage and optimize connection handling and timeouts. Here are some relevant MySQL parameters that could be adjusted to help mitigate the issue:\n\n1. `wait_timeout`: This parameter defines the number of seconds the server waits for activity on a non-interactive connection before closing it. Reducing this value can help clear inactive connections faster.\n\n2. `interactive_timeout`: Similar to `wait_timeout`, but for interactive sessions. Adjusting this might be less relevant unless the connections are considered interactive.\n\n3. `max_connections`: This parameter determines the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. While increasing this might seem like a solution, it's better to manage the connections more efficiently unless absolutely necessary.\n\n4. `back_log`: This parameter defines the number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have. This is the queue of connections that can be served without rejecting any additional connection requests.\n\n5. `thread_cache_size`: Increasing this value allows threads to be reused rather than created and destroyed, which can reduce overhead and potentially reduce the number of connections in a TIME_WAIT state.\n\n6. `skip_name_resolve`: When enabled, this skips the DNS lookup of hosts connecting to the server. If DNS resolution issues contribute to connection delays, enabling this can help.\n\n7. `connect_timeout`: This parameter sets the number of seconds that the MySQL server waits for a connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'. Reducing this might help if connections are hanging at the initial stage.\n\nGiven the details and the focus on managing connections effectively, the recommended parameters to adjust or monitor would be:\n\n```json\n['wait_timeout', 'interactive_timeout', 'max_connections', 'back_log', 'thread_cache_size', 'skip_name_resolve', 'connect_timeout']\n```"}
