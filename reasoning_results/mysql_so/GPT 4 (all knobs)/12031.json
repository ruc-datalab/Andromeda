{"res": "MySQL 5.5.11 is an older version, and querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` can indeed be slow, especially on databases with a large number of tables or complex foreign key relationships. This is because `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries often require MySQL to open and lock many system tables, which can be resource-intensive.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no specific MySQL server parameters in the provided list that directly improve the performance of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries in version 5.5.11. However, here are some general recommendations that might help:\n\n1. **Upgrade MySQL**: Consider upgrading to a newer version of MySQL. Performance improvements, including optimizations around `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries, have been implemented in later versions.\n\n2. **Optimize Queries**: Ensure that your queries are as efficient as possible. In some cases, restructuring a query or using different clauses might help reduce the load.\n\n3. **Hardware Improvements**: Improving the hardware of the server, such as adding more RAM or faster disks, can help improve the overall performance of the database server.\n\n4. **Caching Results**: If the data in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` does not change frequently and real-time data is not crucial, consider caching the results of these queries outside of MySQL to reduce the load on the database.\n\n5. **Reduce Database Size**: If possible, archive old data and reduce the number of tables and rows in the database. A smaller database can sometimes help in speeding up `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries.\n\n6. **Partitioning**: If applicable, partitioning large tables can help in managing and querying large datasets more efficiently.\n\nSince none of the specific parameters listed directly address the performance issues with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in MySQL 5.5.11, the focus should be on broader strategies like those mentioned above. If upgrading MySQL is an option, it is highly recommended as it can bring significant performance improvements and new features that might indirectly help with your issue."}
