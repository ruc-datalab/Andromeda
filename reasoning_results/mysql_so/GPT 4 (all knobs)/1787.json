{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the letter 'a' (and similarly with 'i') having a matching score of 0 in your full-text search queries is likely due to the default behavior of the full-text search in MySQL and MariaDB, where common words (also known as stopwords) are omitted from the full-text index. These stopwords are typically very common words in English, like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\", which do not add significant value to the search but can consume a lot of resources if indexed.\n\nIn your case, 'a' and 'i' are both considered stopwords in the default stopword list used by the full-text search engine in InnoDB. Therefore, they are not indexed, and searches against them return a score of 0 because they do not exist in the full-text index.\n\nTo address this issue, you can modify the behavior regarding stopwords in the following ways:\n\n1. **Change the Stopword File**: You can specify a different stopword file or set it to an empty file if you want to index every word, including typically excluded stopwords.\n\n2. **Disable Stopword Filtering**: You can disable the use of stopwords entirely by setting the system variable `innodb_ft_enable_stopword` to `OFF`.\n\n3. **Adjust the Minimum Word Length**: Ensure that the `ft_min_word_len` and `innodb_ft_min_token_size` are set appropriately so that shorter words are not excluded from the index.\n\nHere are the parameters you might consider adjusting:\n\n- `ft_stopword_file`: Set this to the path of your custom stopword file or an empty file to effectively disable stopword filtering.\n- `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`: Set this to `OFF` to disable the stopword list.\n- `ft_min_word_len`: Adjust this if you want to index shorter words.\n- `innodb_ft_min_token_size`: Similar to `ft_min_word_len`, but specific to InnoDB tables.\n\nBased on your setup and requirements, you might adjust these parameters as follows:\n\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL innodb_ft_enable_stopword = OFF;\nSET GLOBAL ft_min_word_len = 1;\nSET GLOBAL innodb_ft_min_token_size = 1;\n```\n\nRemember, changes to `ft_min_word_len` and `innodb_ft_min_token_size` require a rebuild of the full-text index to take effect. You can do this by dropping the full-text index and then re-creating it.\n\nHere's the list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"ft_stopword_file\", \"innodb_ft_enable_stopword\", \"ft_min_word_len\", \"innodb_ft_min_token_size\"]\n```"}
