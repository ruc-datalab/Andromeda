{"res": "Based on the error message you're encountering (\"Access denied for user 'root@localhost' (using password: NO)\"), it seems the issue is related to authentication and how the Rails application is configured to connect to MySQL. The error suggests that the Rails application is trying to connect to the MySQL database without using a password, even though one is required.\n\nHere are some parameters and settings you might want to check or configure:\n\n1. **`default_authentication_plugin`** - Ensure that the authentication plugin compatible with the mysql2 gem is being used. Rails typically works well with the default MySQL authentication plugin.\n\n2. **`bind_address`** - Make sure MySQL is bound to the correct network interface. It should be set to '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost' if you are connecting locally, which is typical in development environments.\n\n3. **`port`** - Confirm that MySQL is running on the default port (3306) or ensure that the Rails database configuration specifies the correct port if it's different.\n\n4. **`socket`** - Sometimes Rails might try to connect using the Unix socket file instead of TCP/IP. Ensure the path to the MySQL socket file is correctly specified in your Rails database configuration if it's being used.\n\n5. **`skip_networking`** - Ensure this is off to allow TCP/IP connections if not using Unix socket.\n\n6. **`max_connections`** - Ensure MySQL can accept enough connections, including from your Rails application.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you should also check your Rails database configuration file (`config/database.yml`). Make sure it is correctly set up to use MySQL with the right username, password, host, and port. Here is an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\ndefault: &default\n  adapter: mysql2\n  encoding: utf8mb4\n  pool: <%= ENV.fetch(\"RAILS_MAX_THREADS\") { 5 } %>\n  username: root\n  password: <%= ENV['MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD'] %>\n  host: localhost\n\ndevelopment:\n  <<: *default\n  database: your_project_development\n\ntest:\n  <<: *default\n  database: your_project_test\n\nproduction:\n  <<: *default\n  database: your_project_production\n  username: your_production_user\n  password: <%= ENV['MYSQL_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD'] %>\n```\n\nEnsure that the environment variables `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` (and `MYSQL_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD` for production) are set correctly, or directly place the password in the `database.yml` file for testing (not recommended for production).\n\nIf you continue to face issues, you might want to check the MySQL user permissions and ensure that the 'root' user has the appropriate privileges and that its password is correctly set. You can manage user privileges in MySQL using the `GRANT` SQL command."}
