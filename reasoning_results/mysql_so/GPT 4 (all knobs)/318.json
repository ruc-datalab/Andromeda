{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the audit query after upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to MySQL 5.6 might not be directly related to a specific database parameter that can be adjusted. However, it could be related to changes in how MySQL handles subqueries or permissions in the newer version. Here are a few parameters that might influence the behavior of queries and subqueries, although they may not directly resolve the issue if it's due to a bug or a change in MySQL's internal handling of subqueries:\n\n1. **max_allowed_packet** - Ensures large queries are not truncated.\n2. **query_cache_type** - Affects the caching of query results, might influence performance but not behavior.\n3. **sql_mode** - Influences SQL syntax MySQL accepts and the data validation checks it performs.\n\nHowever, these parameters are unlikely to resolve issues specifically related to subqueries on text columns if the behavior change is due to internal changes in MySQL 5.6. It's recommended to check MySQL 5.6 documentation or changelogs for any noted changes in subquery handling or text column indexing and querying. If the problem persists, consider consulting MySQL support forums or filing a bug report.\n\nFor now, the parameters that might be worth examining in relation to general query performance and behavior include:\n\n```plaintext\n['max_allowed_packet', 'query_cache_type', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
