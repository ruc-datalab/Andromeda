{"res": "The behavior you're observing with the MySQL query performance degrading as the number of values in the `IN` clause increases is related to how MySQL optimizes and executes queries with large `IN` lists. When the `IN` list becomes very large, MySQL may switch from using an efficient index-based lookup to a less efficient full table scan or other suboptimal execution plans. This switch can drastically increase the execution time and the perceived number of rows examined, as indicated by the explain plan output.\n\nTo address this issue, you can consider the following MySQL configuration parameters that might help in managing large `IN` lists and optimizing query performance:\n\n1. **`max_seeks_for_key`**: This parameter influences the optimizer's decision on whether to use a table scan or range scan. A lower value might encourage the use of indexes even with large `IN` lists.\n\n2. **`eq_range_index_dive_limit`**: This parameter sets the threshold for switching from index dives to index statistics in equality range optimizations. Adjusting this might affect how MySQL handles large `IN` clauses.\n\n3. **`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`**: Controls the maximum amount of memory that the range optimizer can use while evaluating range conditions, including those with `IN` clauses. Increasing this value might help in handling larger lists without switching to less efficient plans.\n\n4. **`optimizer_search_depth`**: This parameter controls the depth of search for the best execution plan. Adjusting it can influence how MySQL optimizes queries with large `IN` lists.\n\n5. **`read_rnd_buffer_size`**: Increasing this buffer size can improve the performance of full table scans, which might be indirectly beneficial if the optimizer falls back to a table scan for very large `IN` lists.\n\nHere is the output list of these parameters:\n\n```json\n['max_seeks_for_key', 'eq_range_index_dive_limit', 'range_optimizer_max_mem_size', 'optimizer_search_depth', 'read_rnd_buffer_size']\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters requires careful testing and monitoring to ensure that changes lead to the desired improvements without negatively impacting other queries or overall server performance."}
