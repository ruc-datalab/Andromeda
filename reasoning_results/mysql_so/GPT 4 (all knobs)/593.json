{"res": "To enable logging of queries in MySQL to see the queries being run by your application, you need to enable the general log and the slow query log. Based on the output you provided from the `show variables like '%log%';` command, here are the parameters you should adjust:\n\n1. **general_log**: Set this to 'ON' to enable the general query log that records every SQL statement received from clients.\n2. **general_log_file**: This specifies the file where the general log will be written. It's already set to 'C:/xampp/mysql/data/mysql.log', which is fine unless you want to change the location or name of the log file.\n3. **slow_query_log**: Set this to 'ON' to enable the logging of queries that take longer than the time specified in the `long_query_time` parameter.\n4. **slow_query_log_file**: This specifies the file where the slow query log will be written. It's already set to 'C:/xampp/mysql/data/mysql-slow.log', which is fine unless you want to change the location or name of the log file.\n5. **long_query_time**: This parameter defines the time (in seconds) that a query must take to execute before being logged in the slow query log. You might want to adjust this based on how slow you consider a query to be.\n\nHere is the list of parameters you should consider adjusting:\n\n```json\n['general_log', 'general_log_file', 'slow_query_log', 'slow_query_log_file', 'long_query_time']\n```"}
