{"res": "To optimize the stored procedure you've described, which involves recursive querying to fetch all children of a specified parent in a hierarchical structure, you can consider several database parameters that directly influence the performance of such operations. Here are some recommended parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter determines the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. Increasing this size can significantly improve the performance of database operations by reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **max_heap_table_size**: This parameter sets the maximum size of user-created MEMORY tables. Since your procedure uses temporary tables, increasing this size might help if these tables are becoming large.\n\n3. **tmp_table_size**: This parameter specifies the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. MySQL uses this value to decide whether a temporary table can be held in memory or should be converted to an on-disk table. Adjusting this parameter can help optimize the performance of queries that use temporary tables.\n\n4. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger log buffer allows large transactions to run without the need to write the log to disk before the transactions commit, thus speeding up the overall process.\n\n5. **innodb_log_file_size**: Increasing the size of the log file reduces the need for InnoDB to perform a checkpoint flush of the log files, which can improve performance for write-heavy loads and in scenarios where large transactions are common.\n\n6. **query_cache_size** (if applicable, as it's deprecated in MySQL 8.0): If you're using an older version of MySQL, increasing the query cache size can help improve performance by caching the results of queries for faster retrieval.\n\n7. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter can be set to 2 if durability is less of a concern than performance. This setting does not flush the log at every transaction commit and can result in improved performance.\n\n8. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter increases the number of threads that can be cached for reuse. When connections are frequently opened and closed, a larger thread cache size can improve performance.\n\n9. **key_buffer_size**: For MyISAM tables, this parameter adjusts the size of the index buffers, which can improve the performance of index scans.\n\n10. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: This parameter is used after a sort operation to read rows in sorted order. If your queries involve sorting, adjusting this parameter might help.\n\nThese parameters should be adjusted carefully and tested in a development environment before being applied to a production system, as they can affect different aspects of the MySQL server's behavior and performance."}
