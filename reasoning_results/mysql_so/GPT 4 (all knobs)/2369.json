{"res": "Based on the detailed information provided and the issues described, it seems that the server is experiencing resource constraints and MySQL configuration issues that lead to frequent crashes and high resource usage. Here are some recommended MySQL parameters to adjust in order to potentially alleviate these issues:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increase this to a higher value, depending on the total RAM available on your server. This is the memory buffer MySQL uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Since the default is relatively low, increasing it can significantly improve performance if your database size is larger than the current buffer.\n\n2. **max_connections**: It appears that the server might be hitting the maximum connections limit. Consider increasing this value if the current setting is too low for your traffic.\n\n3. **innodb_log_file_size**: This should be increased if you have a high volume of transactions. A larger log file size will allow more transactions to be written to the log before it needs to be flushed to disk.\n\n4. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing this can reduce disk I/O by allowing more transactions to be stored in memory before being flushed to the log file.\n\n5. **query_cache_size**: Given the deprecation in newer MySQL versions, consider disabling the query cache by setting it to 0, especially if your workload is write-heavy or if the queries are not often repeated.\n\n6. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Increase these values to prevent temporary tables from being converted to on-disk tables, which significantly slows down query performance.\n\n7. **table_open_cache**: Increase this value if you have many tables, to reduce the number of file descriptors that MySQL needs to open and close.\n\n8. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. This is useful if you have a high number of new connections per second.\n\n9. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjust these according to your disk's capability to handle I/O operations, which can help in write-heavy environments.\n\n10. **wait_timeout** and **interactive_timeout**: Ensure these are set to appropriate values to avoid too many idle connections consuming system resources.\n\nHere is the output list of parameters based on the recommendations:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"wait_timeout\",\n    \"interactive_timeout\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help mitigate the issues you're experiencing with high resource usage and server crashes. Always ensure to monitor the server's performance after making these changes to validate their impact."}
