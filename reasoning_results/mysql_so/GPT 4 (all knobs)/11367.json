{"res": "To ensure that MySQL logs a timestamp on every line of the general log, you can adjust the `log_timestamps` parameter. This parameter controls the time zone of the timestamp that is logged. By default, it might not be set to include timestamps in the format or frequency you desire. Here\u2019s how you can adjust it:\n\n1. **log_timestamps**: This parameter determines the time zone of the timestamps in the error log, general query log, and slow query log. It can be set to `UTC` or `SYSTEM` (the system's local time zone). Setting this parameter ensures that the logs include a timestamp, but to ensure it's on every line, you might need to ensure the logging format itself is set correctly in MySQL.\n\n2. **general_log**: This parameter needs to be enabled to ensure that logging is active, which you already have.\n\n3. **log_output**: This parameter determines the destination of the log output. It can be set to `FILE`, `TABLE`, or `NONE`. If it's set to `TABLE`, logs are written to the `mysql.general_log` table and might not inherently include the same timestamp details as file-based logging. Ensure it's set to `FILE` for file-based logging with timestamps.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of parameters you should check and set appropriately:\n\n```json\n['log_timestamps', 'general_log', 'log_output']\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust these settings in your MySQL server configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), under the `[mysqld]` section, and restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect. This will ensure that every entry in the general log has a timestamp, making it easier to track when specific events occurred."}
