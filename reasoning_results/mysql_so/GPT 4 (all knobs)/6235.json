{"res": "To address the issue of precision in division operations in MySQL and ensure that you get float division results instead of truncated decimals, you can adjust the following parameters related to SQL mode and numeric type handling:\n\n1. `div_precision_increment`: This parameter sets the precision of the result of division operations. Increasing this value can help in getting more precise results when the denominator is large.\n\n2. `sql_mode`: By setting the SQL mode to include `REAL_AS_FLOAT`, you can ensure that MySQL treats REAL as a floating-point type, which might help in certain contexts where precision is lost in decimal handling.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters based on your description:\n\n```json\n[\"div_precision_increment\", \"sql_mode\"]\n```"}
