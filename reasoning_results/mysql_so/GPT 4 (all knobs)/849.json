{"res": "To address the issue described where `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` does not work from PHP, even though it works from the MySQL command line and `mysql.allow_local_infile` is enabled in PHP, you need to ensure that the MySQL server also allows the use of `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`. This can be controlled by the `local_infile` server system variable.\n\nGiven that you are moving to Amazon RDS, you should be aware that RDS instances have specific parameters that can be set through the RDS parameter groups. Here are the relevant parameters you should consider:\n\n1. **local_infile**: This parameter on the MySQL server side allows or disallows the use of the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` command. For your PHP application to use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, this parameter must be set to `1` (enabled).\n\n2. **max_allowed_packet**: While not directly related to enabling `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, ensuring this parameter is adequately set is crucial because `LOAD DATA INFILE` operations can involve large amounts of data. If the packet size is too small, it might prevent large uploads.\n\n3. **secure_file_priv**: This parameter can restrict the directories from which files can be loaded. Setting this to an empty value or the appropriate directory path might be necessary depending on your file source location.\n\nHere is the output list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"local_infile\", \"max_allowed_packet\", \"secure_file_priv\"]\n```"}
