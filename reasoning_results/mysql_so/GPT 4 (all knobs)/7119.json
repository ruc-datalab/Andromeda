{"res": "To address the issues you're experiencing with MySQL group replication recovery, particularly with servers failing to join the group and remaining stuck in the RECOVERING state, you can adjust several parameters that influence the behavior of group replication, especially in terms of recovery and connection handling. Here are some recommended parameters to consider adjusting:\n\n1. **group_replication_recovery_retry_count**: This parameter determines the number of attempts a server makes to connect to a donor when trying to join the group. Increasing this value can give a server more chances to successfully connect and recover.\n\n2. **group_replication_recovery_reconnect_interval**: This parameter sets the number of seconds to wait between reconnection attempts during the recovery process. Adjusting this might help in environments where transient network issues are causing connection failures.\n\n3. **group_replication_connect_timeout**: This parameter sets the timeout for connections between group members. If the timeout is too short, increasing it might help in situations where network latency or load causes connections to take longer than expected.\n\n4. **group_replication_member_expel_timeout**: Adjusting this parameter can help in deciding how long to wait before expelling a non-responsive group member. This might be relevant if the issue is related to nodes appearing unresponsive due to network delays or misconfigurations.\n\n5. **group_replication_ip_whitelist**: Ensures that the IP addresses of all group members are listed, allowing connections between them. Verify that all member IPs are correctly specified and accessible.\n\n6. **group_replication_ssl_mode**: If SSL is used, ensure that this setting is correctly configured on all nodes to match the security requirements of your environment. Mismatches in SSL configuration can prevent successful group replication setup.\n\n7. **group_replication_recovery_use_ssl**: If SSL is used in your environment, ensure that this parameter is enabled to secure the recovery process.\n\n8. **group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca**, **group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert**, **group_replication_recovery_ssl_key**: Ensure these parameters are correctly set if SSL is used during the recovery process, providing paths to the respective CA file, certificate, and key.\n\nAdjusting these parameters can help resolve issues related to group replication recovery, especially in scenarios involving network issues or configuration mismatches. Here's the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"group_replication_recovery_retry_count\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_reconnect_interval\",\n    \"group_replication_connect_timeout\",\n    \"group_replication_member_expel_timeout\",\n    \"group_replication_ip_whitelist\",\n    \"group_replication_ssl_mode\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_use_ssl\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert\",\n    \"group_replication_recovery_ssl_key\"\n]\n```"}
