{"res": "To address the performance issue you're experiencing with the `ORDER BY` clause in InnoDB after migrating from MyISAM, you can consider adjusting the following InnoDB-specific parameters to potentially improve the query performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter defines the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Increasing this value can significantly improve read performance, especially for large datasets.\n\n2. **innodb_io_capacity**: This parameter specifies the number of I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform. If your server has fast storage (like SSD), increasing this value can help InnoDB better utilize the I/O capacity of the storage.\n\n3. **innodb_sort_buffer_size**: While not directly influencing ORDER BY performance, increasing the sort buffer size can help with the efficiency of sorting operations, which might indirectly benefit your specific query scenario.\n\n4. **innodb_adaptive_hash_index**: This parameter enables or disables the adaptive hash index feature, which can speed up lookups for index searches if the working set fits into the buffer pool. However, it might also have implications on ORDER BY performance depending on the query patterns.\n\n5. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations respectively. Increasing these values can improve the throughput of I/O-bound workloads.\n\n6. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter sets the maximum number of threads that can be inside InnoDB simultaneously. Adjusting this might help manage concurrency more effectively, depending on your server's capabilities and workload.\n\n7. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter affects the balance between strict ACID compliance and higher performance. Setting it to 2 can improve performance but at a slight risk of losing transactions in a crash.\n\n8. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout**: This parameter sets the duration in seconds an InnoDB transaction waits for a row lock before giving up. Adjusting it might help if lock contention is an issue.\n\n9. **innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct**: This parameter sets the maximum percentage of dirty pages in the buffer pool before InnoDB starts flushing them to disk. Adjusting this can influence the write performance and potentially affect overall performance.\n\n10. **innodb_file_per_table**: Enabling this parameter allows InnoDB to store each table and its indexes in a separate file, which can improve performance in some scenarios by reducing contention among tables.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted in your MySQL configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini`) under the `[mysqld]` section. After making changes, you would typically need to restart the MySQL service for the changes to take effect. Always ensure to test changes in a staging environment before applying them in production to avoid unexpected issues.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_adaptive_hash_index\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_lock_wait_timeout\",\n    \"innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\"\n]\n```"}
