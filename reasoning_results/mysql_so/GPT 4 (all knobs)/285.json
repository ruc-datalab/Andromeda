{"res": "To address the issue you're facing with the MySQL error `[1153] Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes`, you can check and set the `max_allowed_packet` parameter. Here's how you can do it using a PHP script:\n\n1. **Check the `max_allowed_packet` value**: You can retrieve the current value of `max_allowed_packet` using a PHP script that connects to your MySQL database and runs a query to fetch this setting.\n\n2. **Set `max_allowed_packet` in your source code**: While you can't permanently change the server setting directly from your PHP code (as it requires server configuration privileges), you can attempt to set it for the duration of your script's execution. However, this is generally not recommended or might not be effective depending on server permissions.\n\nHere's a PHP script example to check and attempt to set the `max_allowed_packet`:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"your_server_name\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Check the max_allowed_packet size\n$sql = \"SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet'\";\n$result = $conn->query($sql);\n\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    // output data of each row\n    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"max_allowed_packet: \" . $row[\"Value\"] . \" bytes<br>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"0 results\";\n}\n\n// Attempt to set max_allowed_packet (This might not work depending on server settings)\n$newMaxSize = 104857600; // for example, setting to 100MB\n$sqlSet = \"SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=$newMaxSize\";\nif ($conn->query($sqlSet) === TRUE) {\n    echo \"max_allowed_packet set successfully\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error setting max_allowed_packet: \" . $conn->error;\n}\n\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\n**Output Parameters**: Based on your request to output the list of parameters, here they are:\n```json\n[\"max_allowed_packet\"]\n```\n\nThis script first checks the current `max_allowed_packet` value and then attempts to set it to a new value. Remember, setting the `max_allowed_packet` requires sufficient privileges, and it's better managed directly through server configuration if possible."}
