{"res": "The error you're encountering in phpMyAdmin is related to the SQL mode settings in MySQL, specifically the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` mode. This mode, when enabled, restricts the SELECT list, HAVING condition, and ORDER BY list to be fully compatible with the GROUP BY clause. In your case, the error \"1055 - 'main.users.type' isn't in GROUP BY\" indicates that the `type` column is being used in the SELECT clause but is not included in the GROUP BY clause, which is not allowed under the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` SQL mode.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either modify your query to include all non-aggregated columns in the GROUP BY clause or adjust the SQL mode to disable `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`. Here are the relevant parameters to consider:\n\n1. **sql_mode** - This parameter allows you to set the SQL mode of the server, which can include or exclude specific modes like `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`.\n\nGiven your scenario, you might consider adjusting the `sql_mode` to exclude `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` if you prefer not to change your queries. However, it's generally recommended to adjust your queries to comply with `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` for better SQL standard compliance and predictable results.\n\nHere's the output list of the relevant parameter:\n\n```json\n[\"sql_mode\"]\n```"}
