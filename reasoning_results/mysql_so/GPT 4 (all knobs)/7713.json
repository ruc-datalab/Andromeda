{"res": "Based on the description of the issue you're facing with MySQL, where the CPU usage spikes and a table has crashed, along with the configuration details you've provided, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your `my.cnf` file to potentially alleviate the problem:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increase the size of the buffer pool to improve the performance of InnoDB tables by caching more data and indexes in memory. This is especially important since you mentioned a table crash, which might be alleviated by having more data in memory, reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **max_connections**: Ensure this is set to a higher value if you expect high concurrent connections, which might be causing the CPU to spike if many connections are waiting.\n\n3. **table_open_cache**: Increase this value to reduce the number of file descriptors that MySQL needs to open and close frequently, which can help in environments with a large number of tables.\n\n4. **innodb_file_per_table**: This is already set to 1, which is good as it helps in managing disk space more efficiently by storing each InnoDB table and its indexes in its own file.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this value to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. This can help in environments where there are many new connections happening.\n\n6. **query_cache_size** and **query_cache_type**: If these are not set, consider enabling and sizing the query cache to reduce the CPU load by caching the result set of frequent queries.\n\n7. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Adjust these to ensure that InnoDB writes are efficiently written to the log files. This can help with write-heavy loads.\n\n8. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Increase these values to allow larger temporary tables to be stored in memory rather than on disk, which can significantly improve performance for complex queries that use temporary tables.\n\n9. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: If set to 1 (default), consider setting it to 2 if you can tolerate a slight delay in commit persistence in exchange for reduced I/O.\n\n10. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: Set this to a higher value if you have many CPUs, which can help utilize CPU resources better.\n\n11. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: Increase these values to improve read and write I/O throughput by allowing InnoDB to use more threads for I/O operations.\n\nGiven the symptoms and the settings you've shared, these adjustments might help mitigate the high CPU usage and improve the stability and performance of your MySQL server. Always ensure to back up your configuration and data before making significant changes, and if possible, test changes in a staging environment first.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_type\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\"\n]\n```"}
