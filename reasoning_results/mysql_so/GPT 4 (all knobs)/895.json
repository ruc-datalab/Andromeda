{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query, it seems that the issue revolves around the system not respecting the `LimitNOFILE` setting specified in the `mysql.service` file. This could be due to several reasons, including misconfiguration or restrictions imposed by the WSL2 environment itself.\n\nHere are some parameters and settings you might consider reviewing or adjusting to address the issues described:\n\n1. **open_files_limit** - This parameter in MySQL directly controls the number of file descriptors that MySQL can open. You might need to ensure this is set high enough in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), ideally matching or being close to the `LimitNOFILE` setting.\n\n2. **table_open_cache** - This parameter determines the number of open tables for all threads. MySQL requires one open file for each table, so make sure this value is aligned with `open_files_limit`.\n\n3. **pid_file** - Ensures the path specified for the PID file is correct and accessible by the MySQL service on startup.\n\n4. **socket** - Verify the MySQL socket configuration. Since you are encountering an error related to the MySQL socket file, ensure the path is correctly specified and accessible.\n\n5. **daemon_memcached_enable_binlog** - Although not directly related to your issue, if you are using the InnoDB with memcached plugin, ensure that binary logging is appropriately configured if required.\n\n6. **innodb_open_files** - If you are using InnoDB tables extensively, this parameter should also be considered as it controls the number of files InnoDB keeps open.\n\nGiven the error messages and the settings you've already checked, the focus should primarily be on ensuring that the `open_files_limit` and `table_open_cache` are configured correctly within MySQL and are not being overridden or limited by external factors such as system limits or WSL2-specific behaviors.\n\nHere's the list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"open_files_limit\", \"table_open_cache\", \"pid_file\", \"socket\", \"daemon_memcached_enable_binlog\", \"innodb_open_files\"]\n```"}
