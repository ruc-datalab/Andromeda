{"res": "Based on the detailed configuration and the issues described after upgrading MySQL from version 5.7 to 8.0, it appears that the performance degradation might be related to several factors including system variables and resource allocation. Here are some parameters that could be tuned to potentially improve the performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is set to 4G, which might be low depending on the total size of your InnoDB tables. Since you have 16GB of RAM, consider increasing this to 8G or 12G to allow more data to be held in memory, reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: Currently set to 16M, this is quite low. Increasing this to 256M or 512M might help, especially if you have transactions that involve a lot of data. Larger log files reduce the need for frequent flushes.\n\n3. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This is set to 2, which is generally a good compromise between performance and reliability. However, if you are experiencing issues with I/O spikes, you might experiment with setting it to 0 if your application can tolerate a bit of data loss in the case of a crash.\n\n4. **max_connections**: Set to 400. Ensure this setting is adequate by checking the number of connections being used during peak times. If you're hitting this limit, consider increasing it.\n\n5. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These are set to 32 and 8, respectively. Given your CPU configuration, you might benefit from increasing the write threads to match the read threads.\n\n6. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: Set to 64, which might be too high or too low depending on your workload. MySQL 8.0 has improved the auto-scaling of threads, so you might try setting this to 0, which allows InnoDB to automatically adjust the concurrency level.\n\n7. **query_cache_size** (if applicable): MySQL 8.0 has removed the query cache due to its inefficiency in multi-threaded workloads. If you migrated from 5.7 and had relied on the query cache, the removal could impact performance. There's no direct replacement, but optimizing queries or using a proxy SQL caching layer might help.\n\n8. **table_open_cache**: This setting might need to be adjusted if you have a large number of tables. Monitor open tables and adjust accordingly.\n\n9. **thread_cache_size**: This helps by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads. You might want to increase this if you see a high rate of new connections.\n\n10. **innodb_flush_neighbors**: Set to 2, which is the default. If you are using SSDs, setting this to 0 can improve performance as SSDs do not have a mechanical head to move.\n\n11. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings are not mentioned but are crucial for performance tuning on systems with SSDs. They should be set based on the I/O ops your storage can handle.\n\n12. **skip_name_resolve**: Enabling this (if not already enabled) can reduce connection delays if DNS is slow or problematic.\n\nGiven the complexity of MySQL tuning, these recommendations should be tested in a controlled environment before being deployed in production. Always ensure you have backups and the ability to roll back changes if needed."}
