{"res": "Based on the scenario described where both error and slow query logs are suddenly empty without a system restart, and considering the behavior of log files in MariaDB, the following parameters could be relevant to investigate:\n\n1. `log_error` - This parameter specifies the file where errors from MariaDB are logged. If this file is being reset or changed, it could explain why the error log appears empty.\n2. `slow_query_log` - This parameter enables the slow query log. If it's turned off or reset, it could stop logging slow queries.\n3. `slow_query_log_file` - Specifies the file where slow queries are logged. Similar to `log_error`, changes or resets to this file could result in an empty log.\n4. `log_output` - Determines the destination of log output (file, table, or none). If this setting is altered, it could redirect log output away from the files.\n5. `log_rotate_on_size` - If set, this parameter rotates the log file when it reaches a specified size, potentially explaining why the log files are empty if they've been rotated and the new logs are not yet written.\n6. `log_error_verbosity` - This controls the verbosity of the error log. A lower setting might reduce the types of errors logged, potentially resulting in an empty file if no relevant errors occur.\n7. `flush_logs` - This command flushes logs, including error and slow query logs. If executed, it could result in the observed behavior.\n\nThese parameters and commands can be checked and adjusted to understand and potentially resolve the issue with the log files appearing empty."}
