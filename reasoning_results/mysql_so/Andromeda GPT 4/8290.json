{"res": "To add CA certificate, client key, and client certificate to the connection string in your Flask application using SQLAlchemy, you typically need to specify these in the connection URI or through additional configuration settings. However, the parameters you've provided from the documentation (like `ssl_crl`, `require_secure_transport`, `ssl_key`, `mysqlx_ssl_crl`) do not directly relate to specifying CA certificate, client key, and client certificate in the SQLAlchemy connection URI.\n\nFor MySQL connections, you would generally use parameters such as `ssl_ca`, `ssl_cert`, and `ssl_key` to specify the path to the CA certificate, client certificate, and client key respectively. These parameters are not explicitly listed in the provided documentation excerpts, but they are standard for configuring SSL connections in MySQL.\n\nGiven the context and typical usage, you would modify your SQLAlchemy database URI to include these SSL parameters. However, since you asked to recommend parameters from the provided documentation and manuals, and none of the parameters directly match the requirement to add CA certificate, client key, and client certificate, I can't recommend any from the provided list that would fulfill this specific need.\n\nIf you were to use standard MySQL SSL parameters not listed in your provided documentation, the recommendation would look like this (not using the provided parameters since they don't match):\n\n```python\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://your-username:your-password@localhost/schema?ssl_ca=/path/to/ca-cert.pem&ssl_cert=/path/to/client-cert.pem&ssl_key=/path/to/client-key.pem'\n```\n\nThis is the typical way to include SSL parameters in a connection URI, but again, these specific parameters (`ssl_ca`, `ssl_cert`, `ssl_key`) are not in your provided list."}
