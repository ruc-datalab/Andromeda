{"res": "Based on the scenario described and the issues faced with the slave being out of sync with the master after a power outage, the following parameters from the provided documentation and user questions are relevant to address the situation:\n\n1. **relay_log_info_repository** - This parameter should be set to 'TABLE' to ensure that the replication SQL thread position is stored in the InnoDB table and updated together with the transaction commit. This helps in maintaining a more accurate and reliable record of the replication position, which is crucial for recovery and synchronization after unexpected shutdowns.\n\n2. **sync_binlog** - Setting this parameter to 1 on the master ensures that the binary log is flushed to disk after each commit. This minimizes the risk of losing events in the binary log due to crashes or power failures, thereby helping the slave to stay in sync with the master.\n\n3. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit** - Setting this parameter to 1 ensures that the contents of the InnoDB redo log buffer are written out to the log file and flushed to disk at each transaction commit. This setting enhances the durability and consistency of the transactions, which is critical in a replication setup to maintain synchronization between master and slave.\n\nThese parameters are crucial for maintaining data integrity and synchronization in a master-slave replication setup, especially in scenarios involving unexpected shutdowns or crashes.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['relay_log_info_repository', 'sync_binlog', 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit']\n```"}
