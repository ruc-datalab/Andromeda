{"res": "Based on the provided information and the issues described in the error logs, the following parameters are relevant to address the issues with the MySQL InnoDB cluster node that is unable to rejoin the cluster:\n\n1. **group_replication_local_address**: This parameter is crucial for setting up the communication port for Group Replication. Ensuring this is correctly configured and matches the expected port settings as per SELinux policies (if SELinux is enabled) is essential.\n\n2. **innodb_force_recovery**: This parameter can be used to force the InnoDB recovery process at server startup. It is useful if the node is experiencing issues that prevent it from starting normally, although care must be taken as it can lead to data loss in certain configurations.\n\nGiven the error logs and the issues with binary logs and GTIDs, these parameters are most relevant to the situation described. The errors indicate problems with replication due to missing binary logs required for GTIDs, which might not be directly solvable through parameter adjustment but rather through ensuring proper binary log retention and synchronization settings.\n\nOutputting the recommended parameters:\n```json\n['group_replication_local_address', 'innodb_force_recovery']\n```"}
