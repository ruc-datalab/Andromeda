{"res": "Based on the user's question and the context provided, the user is dealing with warnings and errors in the context of Oracle PL/SQL packages and functions. The user is specifically concerned with how exceptions and warnings are handled and reported during the compilation and execution of PL/SQL code.\n\nFrom the documentation and parameters provided, the relevant parameters that could influence how errors and warnings are handled and reported in a database environment include:\n\n1. `log_warnings` - This parameter could be relevant if the database system supported a similar parameter for controlling the logging of warnings, but it is more specific to MySQL rather than Oracle.\n\n2. `log_error_verbosity` - This parameter controls the verbosity of error logs in MySQL, which could be analogous to settings in Oracle that control the verbosity of error outputs, but it's not directly applicable to Oracle.\n\n3. `max_error_count` - This parameter limits the number of errors shown, which could be relevant if Oracle has a similar setting for controlling how many errors or warnings are displayed or logged during compilation or runtime.\n\nGiven the context of the user's question, which is focused on handling and reporting of warnings and errors in Oracle PL/SQL, the most directly relevant parameters from the provided list are:\n\n- `log_warnings`\n- `log_error_verbosity`\n- `max_error_count`\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their general relevance to error and warning management in database systems, even though their direct applicability to Oracle might not be exact. The user's question does not directly relate to binary logging or SQL warnings in the context of MySQL, so `binlog_format` and `sql_warnings` are less relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n['log_warnings', 'log_error_verbosity', 'max_error_count']\n```"}
