{"res": "Based on the issue described in the query, where the division operation in MySQLdb is returning a Decimal object with additional significant figures, and considering the behavior of MySQL in handling division operations as described in the documentation, the relevant parameter to adjust would be:\n\n- `div_precision_increment`\n\nThis parameter affects the scale of the result when using two exact-value operands in a division operation. Adjusting this parameter could help in controlling the precision and scale of the division results, potentially addressing the issue of unexpected truncation or additional significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter is:\n\n```['div_precision_increment']```"}
