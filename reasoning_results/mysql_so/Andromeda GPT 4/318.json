{"res": "Based on the provided information and the nature of the query issue described in your question, the most relevant database parameter to consider adjusting is:\n\n- `optimizer_switch`\n\nThis parameter is used to control the behavior of the MySQL optimizer, including how subqueries are handled. Since the upgrade from MySQL 5.5 to MySQL 5.6 has affected the execution of your query, it's possible that changes in the optimizer's default settings or behavior are impacting the subquery execution. Adjusting the `optimizer_switch` settings might help in resolving the issue or at least provide more insight into how the subquery is being processed in MySQL 5.6 compared to MySQL 5.5.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter is:\n```plaintext\n['optimizer_switch']\n```"}
