{"res": "Based on the user's requirement to log queries that generate temporary files, the most relevant parameters to recommend would be those associated with logging queries, particularly those that might be slow or not optimized, as these are likely to generate temporary files. From the provided documentation and previous examples, the parameters that would be most applicable are:\n\n- `slow_query_log`: This parameter enables the logging of queries that take longer than a specified amount of time to execute.\n- `slow_query_log_file`: This parameter specifies the file where slow queries will be logged.\n- `long_query_time`: This parameter sets the threshold in seconds for what is considered a slow query.\n\nThese parameters will help in identifying and logging the queries that are potentially creating temporary files due to their complexity or inefficiency.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['slow_query_log', 'slow_query_log_file', 'long_query_time']\n```"}
