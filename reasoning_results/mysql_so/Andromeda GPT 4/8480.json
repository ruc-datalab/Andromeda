{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issue you are encountering with the word \"for\" still appearing in your search results despite your configuration changes, it seems that the problem might be related to the stopword settings for your InnoDB FullText index.\n\nFrom the documentation and your configuration, you have set `ft_stopword_file` to an empty string, which should disable stopword filtering for MyISAM tables. However, since you are using an InnoDB table, this setting does not apply. InnoDB uses its own stopword list and settings.\n\nYou have already adjusted `innodb_ft_min_token_size` to 2, which is correct for handling shorter words, but the key issue here appears to be related to the handling of stopwords in InnoDB. You need to ensure that the stopword functionality for InnoDB is correctly disabled or adjusted since the default InnoDB stopword list includes common English words like \"for\".\n\nTo address this, you should consider the following parameters related to InnoDB's stopword handling:\n\n1. `innodb_ft_enable_stopword` - This parameter enables or disables the stopword check for InnoDB FullText searches. Setting this to `OFF` can help in ignoring the default stopword list.\n\n2. `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table` or `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table` - These parameters allow you to specify a custom stopword table. If you want to use a custom list or no stopwords at all, you can configure these parameters accordingly.\n\nGiven your scenario and the need to ensure that stopwords are handled correctly in your InnoDB table, I recommend focusing on the parameters that directly affect InnoDB's stopword functionality:\n\n```json\n['innodb_ft_enable_stopword', 'innodb_ft_server_stopword_table']\n```\n\nMake sure to set `innodb_ft_enable_stopword` to `OFF` if you wish to disable the stopword functionality completely for your InnoDB FullText searches. If you decide to use a custom stopword list, configure `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table` with the appropriate table name containing your custom stopwords."}
