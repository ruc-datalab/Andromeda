{"res": "Based on the user's query requirements and the issues described, the most relevant database parameters to recommend from the provided list are:\n\n1. **`max_join_size`** - This parameter could be relevant if the user's query involves complex joins that might exceed the default join size, potentially leading to performance issues or limitations in executing the query.\n\n2. **`sql_mode`** - Adjusting the SQL mode can affect how MySQL handles specific SQL syntax and query results, which might be useful if the user is facing issues with group by behaviors or other SQL functionalities that are not behaving as expected.\n\nGiven the user's need to retrieve the last 2 records for each ID and the issues with their current SQL queries, these parameters might help in optimizing or enabling the desired query behaviors, especially if they involve complex joins or specific SQL mode settings that need adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n['max_join_size', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
