{"res": "To enable logging of all queries that are being run by your application in MySQL, you need to enable the general log. Based on the information provided in your `show variables like '%log%';` output, the `general_log` is currently set to `OFF`. You will need to turn this on and specify the location of the log file if you want to change it from the default. Here are the parameters you should set:\n\n1. `general_log` - Set this to `ON` to enable logging of all queries.\n2. `general_log_file` - This parameter can be used to specify the file where the logs should be written. It is currently set to `C:/xampp/mysql/data/mysql.log`, but you can specify a different file path if required.\n\nThese settings can be adjusted in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini` depending on your setup), typically found in the MySQL directory under your XAMPP installation. After making these changes, you will need to restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your needs are:\n\n```json\n['general_log', 'general_log_file']\n```"}
