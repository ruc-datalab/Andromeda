{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario and questions you've provided regarding deadlocks during DELETE and INSERT operations in MySQL using InnoDB, the relevant parameters to consider for tuning and debugging are:\n\n1. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout**: This parameter defines the duration in seconds that InnoDB will wait for a lock before rolling back the transaction. Adjusting this might help in scenarios where deadlocks are less frequent, and waiting a bit longer for locks could resolve temporary lock contention.\n\n2. **innodb_deadlock_detect**: This enables or disables deadlock detection. When enabled (which is the default), InnoDB automatically detects deadlocks and rolls back one of the transactions. Disabling it might reduce the overhead in highly concurrent systems, but it requires handling timeouts manually.\n\n3. **innodb_print_all_deadlocks**: This parameter, when enabled, logs all deadlock information to the MySQL error log. This is useful for post-mortem analysis to understand how deadlocks are occurring and to adjust application logic or queries to avoid them.\n\nGiven the complexity of your scenario, especially with the nuances of gap locks and next-key locks during DELETE operations, these parameters can be crucial for identifying and mitigating deadlock issues.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n['innodb_lock_wait_timeout', 'innodb_deadlock_detect', 'innodb_print_all_deadlocks']\n```"}
