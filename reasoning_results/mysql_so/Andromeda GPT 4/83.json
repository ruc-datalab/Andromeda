{"res": "Based on the provided scenario where Bengali fonts are displayed as \"?????????????\" when fetched from a MySQL database and displayed in a PHP file, the issue likely lies in the character set and collation settings used in the database connection. The parameters that need to be adjusted to ensure proper handling and display of Bengali characters include:\n\n- `character_set_client`: This parameter sets the character set for the client that sends SQL statements to the server. It should match the encoding used in the client's environment.\n- `character_set_connection`: This parameter sets the character set for the connection between the client and the server. It should be set to handle Bengali characters.\n- `character_set_results`: This parameter sets the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. This includes result data from SELECT statements and metadata such as column names.\n\nThese settings ensure that the data sent from the client, the data exchanged between the client and the server, and the data returned from the server are all handled in an encoding that supports Bengali characters, preventing any misinterpretation or loss of character information.\n\nRecommended parameters:\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n```"}
