{"res": "Based on your query regarding setting `max_allowed_packet` and `wait_timeout` through PHP, it seems you are looking to adjust MySQL server settings via a PHP script. Unfortunately, PHP's `ini_set()` function cannot be used to set MySQL server system variables directly as it is used for configuring PHP runtime settings.\n\nTo adjust MySQL settings like `max_allowed_packet` and `wait_timeout`, you would typically need to set these parameters in the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`) or set them at runtime using SQL statements if the server permits runtime changes.\n\nFor your specific request, the parameters you are interested in are:\n- `max_allowed_packet`\n- `wait_timeout`\n\nThese parameters can be set at runtime using SQL statements if you have the necessary privileges. Here are the SQL commands you would use:\n\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=desired_value;\nSET GLOBAL wait_timeout=desired_value;\n```\n\nReplace `desired_value` with the actual values you want to set.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters based on your query are:\n```plaintext\n['max_allowed_packet', 'wait_timeout']\n```"}
