{"res": "Based on the scenario described and the documentation provided, the parameters `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1` and `sync_binlog=1` are crucial for ensuring data consistency and durability in your replication setup, especially in a multi-AZ environment where failovers are common. However, these settings can indeed impact write performance negatively.\n\nTo address the replication error and also attempt to mitigate the performance degradation, you can consider the following recommendations:\n\n1. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1**: This setting should be maintained as it ensures that the log buffer is written to the log file and the log file is flushed to disk storage at each transaction commit, which is critical for data consistency.\n\n2. **sync_binlog=1**: This ensures that the binary log is flushed to disk at each transaction commit. While this setting is crucial for data durability, especially in a replication setup, it can be the primary cause of the performance hit.\n\nTo improve write performance while keeping these settings:\n- **Optimize InnoDB Configuration**: Adjust other InnoDB parameters such as `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `innodb_log_file_size`, and `innodb_log_buffer_size` to better utilize your server's memory and reduce disk I/O.\n- **Batching Writes**: If possible, batch multiple writes into fewer transactions. This reduces the overhead caused by frequent log flushes.\n- **Hardware Improvements**: Use faster disks such as SSDs, which can significantly improve write and flush performance.\n- **Parallel Replication**: If using MySQL 5.6 or newer, consider using parallel replication to improve the performance of the replica. This doesn't directly improve write performance on the master but can help in maintaining a more up-to-date replica.\n- **Fine-tuning sync_binlog**: If absolutely necessary and after thorough testing, you might experiment with setting `sync_binlog` to a higher value than 1 (e.g., 1000). This means the binary log is synchronized to disk every 1000 commits. Be cautious, as this can risk some data loss in the event of a crash.\n\nGiven the query and the need to balance performance with data integrity, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n['innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit', 'sync_binlog']\n```\n\nThese recommendations aim to maintain the necessary durability and consistency for your replication setup while providing avenues to explore for mitigating the performance impact."}
