{"res": "Given the scenario where you are running a Rails+MySQL stack on a micro instance with limited RAM (620 MB), and MySQL is consuming over 500 MB, leaving very little memory for other processes, it's crucial to optimize MySQL's memory usage. Here are some parameters you can adjust to help reduce the memory footprint of MySQL:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. Since your application is simple and the instance has limited RAM, reducing this value can significantly decrease MySQL's memory usage.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size**: This parameter is used for MyISAM tables to determine the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Reducing this value can help save memory if MyISAM tables are in use, though for a Rails application, InnoDB is typically the default.\n\n3. **max_connections**: This parameter determines the maximum number of simultaneous client connections. Reducing this number can lower the memory required, as MySQL allocates resources for each connection.\n\n4. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter sets the number of threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many already there. Reducing this number can save some memory.\n\n5. **query_cache_size**: If enabled, this parameter sets the amount of memory allocated for caching query results. Reducing or disabling the query cache (by setting it to 0) can free up memory, although it is deprecated and removed in MySQL 8.0.\n\n6. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters specify the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables and heap tables, respectively. MySQL uses these for complex queries, and reducing their size can decrease memory usage.\n\nHere's the recommended list of parameters to adjust based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'max_connections', 'thread_cache_size', 'query_cache_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size']\n```\n\nAdjust these parameters carefully, starting with conservative changes, and monitor the system to ensure that performance remains acceptable."}
