{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you are encountering with SSL/TLS connections in the Python MySQL connector, the relevant parameters to consider are related to configuring SSL/TLS settings for the connection. However, the specific parameters to set the SSL/TLS protocol version or to check the protocol used on an established connection are not directly available as simple connection arguments in `mysql-connector-python`.\n\nTo address your needs, you can use the `ssl_ca`, `ssl_cert`, and `ssl_key` parameters to specify the path to the SSL certificate files, which can help in establishing a secure connection. Additionally, you might consider using the `ssl_disabled` parameter to disable SSL if troubleshooting is necessary (though this is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns).\n\nHere are the recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n1. `ssl_ca`: Specifies the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file.\n2. `ssl_cert`: Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file.\n3. `ssl_key`: Specifies the path to the SSL key file.\n4. `ssl_disabled`: Disables SSL/TLS for the connection.\n\nSince you mentioned the need to specify a specific version like TLS 1.2, this typically involves configuring the SSL context in Python and then passing it to the connector, but `mysql-connector-python` does not directly expose settings for SSL/TLS versions as parameters. You would need to handle this at the SSL context level in Python, which is not directly supported by the simple connection parameters.\n\nTherefore, the list of parameters that can be directly recommended based on your description and the capabilities of `mysql-connector-python` are:\n\n```json\n[\"ssl_ca\", \"ssl_cert\", \"ssl_key\", \"ssl_disabled\"]\n```\n\nThese parameters can help you configure SSL/TLS settings for your MySQL connection in Python, although they do not directly address the version specification issue. For that, further customization of the SSL context in Python or updates to the MySQL server configuration might be necessary."}
