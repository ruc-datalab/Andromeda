{"res": "Based on the description of your issue with handling large result sets and complex queries in Laravel using PDO, particularly when the number of rows exceeds 50,000 and involves joins, it seems likely that you are encountering memory or resource limits. Here are the recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n1. **`max_allowed_packet`** - Increasing this parameter can help if the issue is related to the size of the data being transferred in a single packet. This is particularly relevant if your queries involve large columns or a large amount of data being returned in a single query.\n\n2. **`sql_select_limit`** - This parameter can be used to limit the number of rows returned by SELECT queries. Adjusting this might help manage the load by fetching fewer rows at a time, although it would require application logic changes to handle pagination or iterative fetching.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their relevance to handling large datasets and complex queries, which align with the symptoms described in your query.\n\nOutput list: `['max_allowed_packet', 'sql_select_limit']`"}
