{"res": "Based on the details provided in the query and the nature of the error encountered during the execution of a MySQL query involving REGEX, the most relevant parameters to adjust would be those related to execution timeouts. The error \"#3699 - Timeout exceeded in regular expression match\" specifically points to a timeout during the execution of a statement, which suggests that the timeout settings for statement execution need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted.\n\nFrom the provided documentation and the nature of the issue, the following parameters are recommended:\n\n- `wait_timeout`: This parameter defines the amount of time that MySQL will wait for a connection to be idle before closing it. Although this might not directly relate to the REGEX execution timeout, it's often adjusted in scenarios involving long-running queries to ensure connections remain open.\n\n- `max_execution_time`: This parameter sets the maximum execution time for individual SQL statements. This is particularly relevant here as the error directly relates to the execution time of a REGEX operation within a SQL statement.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to adjust in this scenario are:\n\n```json\n['wait_timeout', 'max_execution_time']\n```"}
