{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the reference to the MySQL documentation and previous examples, the relevant parameters to consider for your issue with the slow query log are:\n\n- `long_query_time`\n- `log-queries-not-using-indexes`\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the behavior you're observing where queries with execution times far below the `long_query_time` threshold are being logged. The `log-queries-not-using-indexes` parameter can cause queries that do not use indexes to be logged regardless of their execution time, which might be why you are seeing such quick queries in your slow query log.\n\nHere is the recommended list of parameters:\n\n```json\n['long_query_time', 'log-queries-not-using-indexes']\n```"}
