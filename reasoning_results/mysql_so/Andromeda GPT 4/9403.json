{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query about finding duplicate rows in a large MySQL table of 40,000,000 rows, and considering the parameters discussed in the reference questions, the most relevant parameters to recommend for improving the performance of your duplicate finding script would be:\n\n- `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: This parameter is crucial for performance in InnoDB, the default storage engine for MySQL. It determines the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Increasing this size can significantly improve read operations and overall database performance, especially for large datasets.\n\n- `sql_mode`: Adjusting SQL mode can help in handling how MySQL manages data validation and error handling. While it might not directly impact performance, ensuring strict SQL modes can prevent data inconsistencies and ensure data integrity, which is crucial when dealing with duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters for your scenario are:\n```plaintext\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
