{"res": "Based on the details provided in the query and the context of the issue described, the most relevant database parameters to recommend would be:\n\n- `cursorclass`: This parameter is crucial as it determines the type of cursor used, which in turn affects the format of the results returned by queries. The use of `pymysql.cursors.DictCursor` is intended to return results as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with column names as keys.\n\n- `connect_timeout`: This parameter is mentioned in the setup of the database connection and is relevant to ensure that the connection does not time out, especially when executing complex queries that might take longer to complete.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n```plaintext\n['cursorclass', 'connect_timeout']\n```"}
