{"res": "Based on the details provided in your configuration and the MySQLTuner output, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your MySQL configuration to potentially help with the high CPU usage and other performance issues:\n\n1. **thread_cache_size** - Increasing this value can help reduce the overhead of creating new threads. You already have it set to 32, but considering the high number of connections, you might want to increase it further.\n\n2. **table_open_cache** - You have it set to 12000, which seems quite high. However, if your application opens many tables, this high value might be justified. Ensure it matches the number of open tables observed in your performance metrics.\n\n3. **key_buffer_size** - This is set to 128M; ensure this is sufficient by checking MyISAM indexes sizes (if MyISAM tables are significantly used).\n\n4. **query_cache_size** and **query_cache_type** - Your query cache is disabled (`query_cache_type = 0`). If your workload involves many identical queries and the data does not change often, enabling the query cache might help. However, be cautious as the query cache can also be a source of contention.\n\n5. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This is set relatively low at 128M, especially considering you have InnoDB tables. Increasing this value can significantly improve performance for InnoDB tables by reducing disk I/O.\n\n6. **max_connections** - You have this set to 500. Ensure this setting is aligned with your hardware capabilities and application needs. High values can lead to high memory usage and CPU overhead.\n\n7. **join_buffer_size** - This parameter is not explicitly set in your configuration, but consider increasing it if you have many complex joins that do not use indexes effectively.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size** - Currently set to 2M, you might need to adjust this if you have queries that perform large sorts.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size** - Set at 5M, which is quite high. This setting can increase memory usage per connection significantly, so adjust with caution.\n\n10. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These are both set to 128M. These parameters should generally be the same to prevent issues with temporary tables becoming too large and being converted to on-disk tables, which are much slower.\n\n11. **innodb_log_file_size** - This is set to 16M. Depending on your workload, increasing this might help reduce the I/O load by allowing more data to be stored in the log before it needs to be flushed to disk.\n\n12. **skip-name-resolve** - This is already set in your configuration, which is good as it can help reduce connection times and CPU usage by avoiding DNS lookups.\n\nGiven these recommendations, your adjusted parameters list would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['thread_cache_size', 'table_open_cache', 'key_buffer_size', 'query_cache_size', 'query_cache_type', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'max_connections', 'join_buffer_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_buffer_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'innodb_log_file_size']\n```"}
