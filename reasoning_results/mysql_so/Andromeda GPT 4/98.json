{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you are encountering with MySQL 5.7, particularly with the `sql_mode` settings affecting the behavior of your GROUP BY queries, the recommended parameter to adjust would be:\n\n['sql_mode']\n\nYou might consider adjusting the `sql_mode` to either disable `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` or to configure it in a way that accommodates your specific query requirements. This can be done by modifying the `sql_mode` setting to remove `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` or to include other modes that might help in handling GROUP BY queries more flexibly. Here's how you can modify it:\n\n```sql\nSET sql_mode = '';\n```\n\nor, if you want to keep other modes and just remove `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`:\n\n```sql\nSET sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL,NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO';\n```\n\nThis adjustment should help resolve the errors you're seeing in phpMyAdmin and align the behavior of MySQL 5.7 with what you expect based on your experience with MySQL 5.6."}
