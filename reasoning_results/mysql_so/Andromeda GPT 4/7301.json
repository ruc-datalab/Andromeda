{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the nature of the stored procedure you are using to fetch all children (nth level) of a specified parent, the following database parameters could be relevant to optimize the performance of your recursive queries:\n\n1. **max_sp_recursion_depth**: This parameter controls the maximum recursion depth for stored procedures. Increasing this value allows deeper recursion levels, which might be necessary if your hierarchy has many levels. However, care should be taken as very deep recursion can lead to high memory usage and potential stack overflow.\n\n2. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter controls the balance between strict ACID compliance and higher performance with respect to transaction logs. Setting this parameter to 2 can improve performance by reducing I/O operations, as the log buffer is written to the log file and flushed to disk only once per second. However, this might risk losing up to one second of transactions in case of a crash.\n\nGiven the nature of your stored procedure, which involves multiple temporary table creations and deletions within a loop, these parameters might help in optimizing the performance:\n\n- **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters determine the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. If exceeded, the server automatically converts in-memory temporary tables to on-disk tables. Increasing these values might reduce disk I/O if your temporary tables are becoming too large.\n\n- **query_cache_size** (deprecated in MySQL 8.0): If you are using an older version of MySQL, enabling and sizing the query cache can improve performance for repeat queries, although this does not apply to your current procedure since it involves a lot of writes.\n\nHere is the recommended list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"max_sp_recursion_depth\", \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\"]\n```\n\nAdjust these parameters carefully and monitor the system's performance and stability after changes."}
