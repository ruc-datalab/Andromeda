{"res": "Based on the details provided in the query and the context of the issues described, the relevant MySQL parameters that could be recommended are:\n\n- `default_storage_engine`\n- `character_set_server`\n\nThese parameters are relevant because:\n\n1. `default_storage_engine`: This parameter could be adjusted to ensure that the database uses an engine that supports the desired features, such as `utf8mb4` encoding, which is crucial for supporting a wider range of Unicode characters without encountering index size issues.\n\n2. `character_set_server`: Adjusting this parameter could help ensure that the server-level character set configuration supports `utf8mb4`, which might help in avoiding issues related to character encoding mismatches.\n\nThus, the recommended parameters list is:\n\n```json\n['default_storage_engine', 'character_set_server']\n```"}
