{"res": "Based on the provided information and the context of the query, the relevant parameters to recommend for the issue described in the C# application connected to a MySQL database are:\n\n- `character_set_client`\n- `character_set_results`\n- `collation_connection`\n\nThese parameters are crucial for ensuring that the character set and collation settings are correctly configured in the MySQL session to handle German language outputs as expected. The `character_set_client` and `character_set_results` ensure that the data sent to and from the server is encoded correctly, while `collation_connection` affects comparison and sorting that respects German language specifics.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters list is:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_results', 'collation_connection']\n```"}
