{"res": "Based on the description of the issue where emojis are being stored as \"???\" in the database, it seems that the problem is related to character encoding. Emojis require UTF-8 encoding with the `utf8mb4` character set, as it supports the full range of Unicode characters including emojis. The parameters that need to be set to ensure proper handling of emojis in the database are related to the character set and collation settings.\n\nFrom the provided candidate parameters and the nature of the problem, the recommended parameters to resolve the issue with storing emojis are:\n\n- `character_set_server`\n- `character_set_client`\n- `character_set_connection`\n- `character_set_results`\n\nThese parameters ensure that the connection between the client (PHP application) and the server (MySQL database) uses the correct character set that supports emojis. Setting these parameters to `utf8mb4` will likely resolve the issue.\n\nOutput list of recommended parameters:\n```json\n['character_set_server', 'character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results']\n```"}
