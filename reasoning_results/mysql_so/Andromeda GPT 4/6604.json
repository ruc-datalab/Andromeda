{"res": "Based on the detailed information provided about the RDS MySQL server's memory utilization and configuration, and considering the high memory consumption issues you are facing, here are some recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is already set quite high at 144 GB, which is appropriate for the given total memory of 240 GB. However, you might consider slightly reducing it if there's no significant performance impact, to allow more memory for other processes and buffer needs.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_instances**: Increasing the number of buffer pool instances can help in managing memory more efficiently, especially with such a large buffer pool size. Consider setting this to a higher value, such as 8 or 16, to improve concurrency and reduce contention within the buffer pool.\n\n3. **max_connections**: The current setting is extremely high (20484). Unless you have evidence that this many connections are required, consider reducing this number. High numbers of connections can lead to increased memory usage and contention.\n\n4. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this parameter to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. Given the high number of max connections, a higher thread cache size might be beneficial.\n\n5. **table_open_cache** and **table_definition_cache**: These parameters should be adjusted based on the number of tables you frequently access. Increasing these caches can reduce disk I/O by keeping table metadata in memory.\n\n6. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These are set to 4096 MB, which might be unnecessarily high in most scenarios. Consider reducing these sizes unless you have specific workloads that require large temporary tables.\n\n7. **query_cache_size**: Given that the query cache can often lead to performance degradation on highly concurrent systems (and is deprecated in later MySQL versions), consider disabling it by setting `query_cache_size = 0`.\n\n8. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This is set to 64 MB. Depending on your workload, especially if you have many write-heavy operations, you might benefit from increasing this to reduce disk I/O for log writes.\n\n9. **sort_buffer_size**, **read_buffer_size**, **read_rnd_buffer_size**, and **join_buffer_size**: These are set relatively low. Depending on your query patterns, increasing these might help, but be cautious as setting these too high globally can lead to excessive memory usage. Consider adjusting them on a session basis based on specific workload requirements.\n\n10. **binlog_cache_size**: If you are using binary logging and have transactions that update many rows, consider increasing this value to reduce the need for writing multiple times to the binary log during a transaction.\n\nHere is the list of parameters to consider adjusting based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_instances\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"table_definition_cache\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"binlog_cache_size\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should help in managing the memory utilization more effectively on your RDS MySQL instance. Always ensure to monitor the impact of these changes and adjust accordingly."}
