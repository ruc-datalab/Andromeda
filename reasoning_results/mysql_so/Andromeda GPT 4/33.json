{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the memory usage spikes during operations like \"optimize table\" and considering the size and structure of your database, the following parameters are recommended to potentially help manage memory usage and performance in your MySQL Docker container:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter is crucial for InnoDB performance as it defines the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Given the size of your large table and the fact that it has indexes on every column, increasing this value might help, especially if your system has enough RAM.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter is used for MyISAM tables to determine the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Adjusting this might not be directly relevant if your tables are InnoDB, but it's important if any MyISAM tables are used.\n\n3. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables and heap tables, respectively. MySQL uses these for complex queries, which might be causing memory spikes when running \"optimize table\" or other heavy operations.\n\n4. **sort_buffer_size** - This parameter defines the amount of memory allocated to each thread for sorting data. Since sorting can be memory-intensive, especially with large datasets, adjusting this might help manage memory usage during operations that involve sorting.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size** - This parameter affects performance by reducing the number of threads created and destroyed by each connection. Adjusting it can help manage the overhead and improve performance.\n\n6. **join_buffer_size** - This is used for joins that do not use indexes. Even though your tables are indexed, ensuring this is adequately sized can help with complex join operations.\n\nGiven your description, these parameters should be considered for tuning MySQL running in a Docker container on your local machine. Adjusting these settings can help manage memory usage spikes and improve overall database performance. Make sure to monitor the changes to see if further adjustments are necessary.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'thread_cache_size', 'join_buffer_size']\n```"}
