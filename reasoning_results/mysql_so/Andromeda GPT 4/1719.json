{"res": "Based on the error message and the context provided, the issue seems to be related to the capacity of the lock table. The error code 147 indicating \"Lock table is full\" suggests that the system has reached its limit on how many locks it can handle simultaneously. From the list of lock-related variables you provided, the relevant parameter to adjust would be related to the overall handling of table locks, particularly for InnoDB tables, since that's where the error is occurring.\n\nGiven the parameters listed in your documentation and the error context, the most relevant parameter to adjust would be:\n\n- `innodb_table_locks`\n\nThis parameter controls whether InnoDB performs a table lock when executing LOCK TABLES. Since the error suggests a problem with the capacity of the lock table, adjusting this parameter might help. Setting `innodb_table_locks` to 0 could potentially alleviate the issue by preventing InnoDB from acquiring table-level locks, thus reducing the load on the lock table.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to modify is:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_table_locks']\n```"}
