{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of the error encountered in PostgreSQL, it appears that the issue might not be directly related to specific PostgreSQL parameters that can be adjusted. The error message \"vsnprintf failed: Invalid argument\" suggests a possible issue with the underlying system or the tool (Navicat Premium) being used rather than a database parameter that can be toggled or set.\n\nHowever, if we consider general parameters that could potentially influence the behavior of dropping tables in PostgreSQL, we might think about transaction-related parameters or those affecting foreign key checks, similar to MySQL. In PostgreSQL, foreign key checks are always enforced and cannot be disabled like in MySQL with `foreign_key_checks`. The closest parameter in PostgreSQL that might be relevant in a broader sense (though not directly applicable to the error message) is:\n\n- `session_replication_role`: This parameter allows temporary disabling of trigger-based replication and foreign key checks within a session, which can be useful when bulk loading data or deleting tables that are part of a replication setup.\n\nGiven the nature of the error and the lack of direct relevance of PostgreSQL parameters to the specific error message, the recommended parameters list would be minimal. If we were to suggest a parameter based on the broader context of managing table deletions and constraints, it would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['session_replication_role']\n```\n\nThis recommendation is made with the caveat that the actual error might need investigation at the system or application level (Navicat Premium) rather than through PostgreSQL configuration."}
