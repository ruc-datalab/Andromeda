{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the issues you are facing with MySQL server performance, here are some recommended parameters that you might consider adjusting in your `my.cnf` configuration file to help address high CPU usage and improve overall server performance:\n\n1. **max_connections**: This parameter defines the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. Since you are experiencing high CPU usage, it might be helpful to limit this number to prevent overloading the server.\n\n2. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter determines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put into the cache if there aren't too many already there. Reusing threads can be faster than creating new ones.\n\n3. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is the size of the buffer pool, where InnoDB caches table and index data. Increasing this value can significantly improve the performance of MySQL operations by reducing the amount of disk I/O needed.\n\n4. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables for storing intermediate results might cause issues if these tables are converted to on-disk tables when they exceed the limits specified by these parameters.\n\n5. **innodb_file_per_table**: This parameter enables InnoDB to store each table and its indexes in a separate .ibd file. This can improve performance when you have a large database with many tables, as it allows for better I/O optimization and easier management of individual tables.\n\n6. **query_cache_size**: Since you mentioned that the issue wasn't present before and suddenly appeared, it might be useful to enable and configure the query cache to cache the results of frequent queries. However, this parameter is deprecated in MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0. If you are using an older version, you can still use it.\n\n7. **performance_schema**: Enabling the Performance Schema can help in diagnosing performance issues by providing detailed timing and other information about server events.\n\n8. **innodb_io_capacity**: This parameter specifies the number of I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform. Adjusting this value can help balance I/O throughput with other system operations.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size** and **read_rnd_buffer_size**: These parameters define the size of the buffers that MySQL uses for sequential and random read operations. Adjusting these might help reduce disk I/O by increasing the amount of data read in one go.\n\nGiven your situation and the sudden spike in CPU usage, it's also recommended to check for any abnormal activities or slow queries that might be affecting performance. Make sure to monitor the server closely after making any changes to the configuration.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your scenario:\n```json\n[\"max_connections\", \"thread_cache_size\", \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\", \"innodb_file_per_table\", \"query_cache_size\", \"performance_schema\", \"innodb_io_capacity\", \"read_buffer_size\", \"read_rnd_buffer_size\"]\n```"}
