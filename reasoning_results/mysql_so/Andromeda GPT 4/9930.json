{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the issues you are encountering with syntax errors during the import of a large SQL dump, the most relevant parameters to consider adjusting are:\n\n1. `max_allowed_packet` - You've already set this to a very high value (1G), which should generally be sufficient for most large queries. However, it's good to confirm that this setting is consistent across both the server where the dump was taken and the server where the import is being attempted.\n\n2. `character_set_client` - Since the error mentions a syntax issue and the line number is inconsistent, there might be a problem related to character set mismatches or issues in how certain queries are interpreted by MariaDB. Ensuring that the character set settings are consistent and appropriate for the data being imported could help resolve these syntax errors.\n\nGiven the nature of the error and the settings you've already tried, the recommended parameters to focus on are:\n\n```json\n['max_allowed_packet', 'character_set_client']\n```"}
