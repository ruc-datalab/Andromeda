{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where the goal is to reduce the frequency of write operations to the database to alleviate stress on the SD card used by a Raspberry Pi, and considering the information provided in the manuals and your specific requirements, the following parameters are recommended:\n\n1. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Setting this parameter to 2 would be beneficial as it flushes the log to the disk every second rather than on every transaction commit. This reduces the number of write operations but still provides a reasonable level of data safety. Although this setting affects all tables, it's a server-wide setting that can significantly reduce disk I/O.\n\n2. **innodb_flush_method**: This parameter can be set to reduce I/O strain by changing how data is written to disk. Although not specifically mentioned in your scenario, adjusting this parameter can help optimize how InnoDB handles write operations to the disk.\n\nGiven the constraints and the focus on reducing write frequency, these parameters should help achieve the desired outcome:\n\n- **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Set to 2 to reduce the frequency of flush operations.\n- **innodb_flush_method**: Consider setting this to 'O_DIRECT' to avoid double buffering between the InnoDB buffer pool and the OS file system, which can be beneficial on systems with limited I/O capacity like an SD card.\n\nThus, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n[\"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\", \"innodb_flush_method\"]\n```"}
