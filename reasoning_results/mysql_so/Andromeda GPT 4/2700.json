{"res": "To improve the performance of the OPTIMIZE statement for MyISAM tables, especially when the status shows \"Repair by sorting,\" you can consider adjusting the following parameters based on the information provided in the manuals:\n\n1. **`myisam_sort_buffer_size`** - Increasing this parameter will allocate more memory for sorting during the OPTIMIZE operation, which can speed up the process when dealing with large index files.\n\n2. **`key_buffer_size`** - Although primarily used for caching MyISAM index blocks, ensuring this is adequately sized can help overall performance, but it is less directly related to the sorting process during OPTIMIZE.\n\n3. **`myisam_max_sort_file_size`** - Setting this to a high value can increase the likelihood that the server uses a faster filesort method rather than a slower key cache method during the repair or optimization process.\n\nIncreasing `sort_buffer_size` is not directly recommended for optimizing MyISAM tables as it is generally used for sorting within individual SQL operations rather than table maintenance operations like OPTIMIZE.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to adjust are:\n```plaintext\n['myisam_sort_buffer_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'myisam_max_sort_file_size']\n```"}
