{"res": "Based on the error message you're encountering and the details provided in the documentation and previous user questions, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n1. `max_connect_errors` - This parameter determines the number of connection errors from a host before the server blocks that host. Adjusting this might help if legitimate connection attempts are being incorrectly counted as errors due to network issues or other intermittent problems.\n\n2. `flush` - This is relevant as you've already used the `mysqladmin flush-hosts` command to clear the block on the host. You might need to do this again if the block reoccurs, but it would be more beneficial to address the root cause of the connection errors.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to focus on are:\n```json\n['max_connect_errors', 'flush']\n```"}
