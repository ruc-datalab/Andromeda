{"res": "Based on the error message you are receiving and the context of the issue, it seems that the problem is related to foreign key constraints when trying to delete a row from the `inventory` table that is still referenced by another table (possibly a `rental` table or similar). The foreign key constraint prevents the deletion to maintain referential integrity in the database.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider temporarily disabling foreign key checks, perform the deletion, and then re-enabling the foreign key checks. This should only be done with caution and understanding of the implications in your specific database environment.\n\nThe recommended parameter to manage this situation is:\n\n```['foreign_key_checks']```\n\nThis parameter can be set to 0 to disable the checks and set back to 1 to re-enable them. Here is how you can use it:\n\n```sql\nSET foreign_key_checks = 0;\nDELETE FROM inventory\nWHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title = \"ACADEMY DINOSAUR\")\nAND store_id = 1\nLIMIT 1;\nSET foreign_key_checks = 1;\n```\n\nThis approach temporarily bypasses the foreign key constraint, allowing you to delete the row. However, ensure that this does not lead to orphaned records or inconsistencies in your database."}
