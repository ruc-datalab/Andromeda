{"res": "To address the issue of excluding \"FLUSH TABLES\" commands from being replicated in a MySQL master-master setup, you can use the following parameter:\n\n- `sql_log_bin`\n\nThis parameter can be set dynamically before issuing the \"FLUSH TABLES\" command and reset after the command is executed. By setting `sql_log_bin` to 0, you can temporarily disable the binary logging of commands, which means the \"FLUSH TABLES\" command will not be replicated to the other master. Remember to set `sql_log_bin` back to 1 after the command to resume normal replication logging.\n\nRecommended parameter list:\n```json\n['sql_log_bin']\n```"}
