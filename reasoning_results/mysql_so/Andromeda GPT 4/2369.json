{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the issues you are experiencing with your Digital Ocean server running WordPress, and considering the symptoms and logs provided, the following parameters are recommended to help address the high memory/processing usage and frequent server crashes:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter can help improve the performance of MySQL operations by allowing more data to be stored in memory, reducing disk I/O. Given the frequent high disk I/O observed, this could be beneficial.\n\n2. **max_connections**: Increasing the maximum number of connections that MySQL can handle at one time can prevent errors related to too many connections, especially if your site experiences spikes in traffic.\n\n3. **thread_cache_size**: Adjusting this parameter can help manage the number of threads MySQL maintains in cache. It can improve performance by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.\n\n4. **wait_timeout**: This parameter defines how long the server waits for a non-interactive connection before closing it. Adjusting this might help with managing resources better if connections are not being closed promptly.\n\n5. **max_allowed_packet**: Increasing this parameter can help with the errors related to packet size that are seen in the logs, which can occur when large data packets are sent to MySQL.\n\n6. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this parameter can reduce the number of disk I/O operations by caching more table information in memory.\n\n7. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing this parameter can reduce disk I/O by writing log information to the buffer in memory before writing it to the log file on disk.\n\n8. **query_cache_size**: Although deprecated in later versions of MySQL, if applicable, adjusting this parameter can help improve query performance by storing the result set in cache.\n\nThese parameters should be adjusted carefully and monitored to see their effect on performance. It's also recommended to ensure that your server has enough physical memory to support increasing memory-related parameters. Additionally, consider optimizing your WordPress setup, plugins, and themes to ensure they are efficiently using resources.\n\nOutput list as requested:\n```json\n[\"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"max_connections\", \"thread_cache_size\", \"wait_timeout\", \"max_allowed_packet\", \"table_open_cache\", \"innodb_log_buffer_size\", \"query_cache_size\"]\n```"}
