{"res": "Based on the provided scenario and the issues you are encountering with GTID-based replication across multiple master servers into a single slave server, it seems that your configuration parameters are generally correct for enabling GTID replication. However, the issue of \"Duplicate Entry errors\" suggests possible problems with the initial data state or conflicts arising during replication.\n\nHere are some parameters and additional considerations that might help resolve or mitigate the issues:\n\n1. **gtid_mode**: Ensures that every transaction is associated with a Global Transaction Identifier.\n2. **enforce_gtid_consistency**: Ensures that only GTID-consistent statements are allowed if GTID_MODE is ON.\n3. **log_bin**: Enables binary logging, which is necessary for replication.\n4. **log_slave_updates**: If set to true, the slave (in this case, your single server consolidating multiple masters) will log the updates performed by its SQL thread to its own binary log.\n5. **master_auto_position**: Enables automatic positioning for GTID-based replication, which you've already set in your CHANGE MASTER TO command.\n\nGiven your setup and the issues described, here are some additional steps and checks you might consider:\n\n- **Ensure Unique server-id**: Each server in your replication topology must have a unique `server-id`. Double-check the `server-id` for each master and the slave to ensure there are no conflicts.\n- **Check for Initial Data Consistency**: Ensure that the data dumped from each master and loaded into the slave was consistent at the point of the dump. Any discrepancies here can lead to issues like the duplicate entry errors you're seeing.\n- **Error Handling**: Consider setting up error handling for replication errors. MySQL 5.6 and later supports replication error handling which can be configured to skip certain types of errors automatically:\n  - `slave_skip_errors`: This parameter can be set to skip specific error numbers (e.g., duplicate key errors).\n  - `slave_transaction_retries`: This parameter determines how many times the slave SQL thread will retry a transaction in case it encounters a temporary error before stopping with an error.\n\n- **Consistency Checks**: Perform consistency checks between the masters and the slave. Tools like `pt-table-checksum` and `pt-table-sync` from Percona Toolkit can be helpful for this.\n\n- **Monitoring and Logs**: Keep a close eye on the replication error logs for any specific errors or warnings that might give more insight into the issues you're facing.\n\nGiven the complexity of your setup (multiple masters to a single slave), ensuring data consistency at the start and handling conflicts efficiently is crucial. Here's the list of recommended parameters based on your setup and issues:\n\n```json\n[\"gtid_mode\", \"enforce_gtid_consistency\", \"log_bin\", \"log_slave_updates\", \"master_auto_position\"]\n```\n\nThese parameters should be correctly set and reviewed along with the additional considerations and checks mentioned above to help stabilize your replication setup."}
