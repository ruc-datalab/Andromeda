{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of MySQL 5.7's password policy requirements, the relevant parameter to address the issue of creating a user with a password that does not meet the minimum length requirement is:\n\n- `validate_password_length`\n\nThis parameter determines the minimum required length for passwords. In MySQL 5.7, the default setting for `validate_password_length` is 8, which is why the attempt to set a six-character password fails.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to adjust in order to allow a six-character password (though reducing password length is generally not recommended for security reasons) is:\n\n```plaintext\n['validate_password_length']\n```"}
