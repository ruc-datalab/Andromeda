{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of the question, the user is trying to listen to MySQL change events using the ZongJi module, which relies on MySQL's binary logging mechanism. The user has already configured binary logging but is unable to see specific row changes in their application. The relevant parameters to ensure that the binary logging is capturing the necessary details for ZongJi to function correctly would include ensuring that the binary log format is set to row-based, as this is necessary for capturing the detailed row changes.\n\nFrom the provided manuals and previous questions, the relevant parameters to recommend would be:\n\n- `binlog_format`: This parameter should be set to 'ROW' to ensure that the binary log captures row-based changes, which are necessary for the ZongJi module to detect and relay specific row changes.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters list is:\n\n```json\n['binlog_format']\n```"}
