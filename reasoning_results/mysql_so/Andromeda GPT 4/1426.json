{"res": "Based on the error description you provided, where the host is blocked due to many connection errors, the relevant parameters to consider from the provided documentation and user questions are:\n\n- `flush`\n- `max_connect_errors`\n\nThese parameters are directly related to handling and resolving issues with hosts being blocked due to excessive connection errors. Here's why these parameters are recommended:\n\n1. `flush`: This parameter is used to clear the host cache, which can unblock hosts that have been blocked due to exceeding the `max_connect_errors` limit.\n2. `max_connect_errors`: Adjusting this parameter can help define the threshold of allowed connection errors before a host is blocked, potentially preventing frequent blocks if set appropriately.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n```plaintext\n['flush', 'max_connect_errors']\n```"}
