{"res": "Based on the issues described in your query regarding the handling of Unicode text and the database collation settings, the following parameters are recommended to ensure proper handling of UTF-8 encoding in your PHP and MySQL setup:\n\n1. **`character_set_client`** - This parameter ensures that the client (in this case, your PHP script) sends SQL statements to the server using the UTF-8 character set.\n\n2. **`character_set_connection`** - This parameter sets the character set for the connection between your PHP script and the MySQL server to UTF-8. This ensures that data sent back and forth is encoded correctly.\n\n3. **`character_set_results`** - This parameter sets the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. Setting this to UTF-8 ensures that the results you fetch from the database are encoded in UTF-8.\n\n4. **`character_set_database`** - This parameter sets the default character set for the database. This is useful if the database default needs to be explicitly set to UTF-8, although it might already be set as per your database collation settings.\n\n5. **`character_set_server`** - This parameter sets the server\u2019s default character set. Ensuring this is set to UTF-8 can help avoid issues with character encoding at the server level.\n\nThese parameters should be set either in your MySQL server configuration (my.cnf or my.ini file) or dynamically using SQL commands in your PHP script before performing any queries, like so:\n\n```php\nmysqli_query($conn, \"SET character_set_client = 'utf8'\");\nmysqli_query($conn, \"SET character_set_connection = 'utf8'\");\nmysqli_query($conn, \"SET character_set_results = 'utf8'\");\nmysqli_query($conn, \"SET character_set_database = 'utf8'\");\nmysqli_query($conn, \"SET character_set_server = 'utf8'\");\n```\n\nImplementing these settings should help resolve issues with non-Unicode text outputs in your PHP application.\n\nRecommended parameters output list:\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results', 'character_set_database', 'character_set_server']\n```"}
