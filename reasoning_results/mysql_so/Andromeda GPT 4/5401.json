{"res": "Based on the information provided and the error encountered during the installation of the group replication plugin, it appears that the issue is related to the location or absence of the `group_replication.so` library file in the specified plugin directory. The error message indicates that the file could not be found in the expected directory.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant parameter to address this issue is the `plugin_dir` parameter, which specifies the directory where the plugin libraries are located. You may need to ensure that the `group_replication.so` file is present in the directory specified by `plugin_dir` or adjust the `plugin_dir` setting to point to the correct location where the `group_replication.so` file resides.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to focus on is:\n```json\n[\"plugin_dir\"]\n```"}
