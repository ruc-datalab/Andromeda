{"res": "Based on the detailed description and updates provided in the query, the following parameters are relevant to address the issues encountered with Liquibase and MySQL connection stability:\n\n1. `connect_timeout` - This parameter was specifically mentioned as being adjusted to resolve the issue of connection timeouts during operations involving Liquibase. Increasing this value helped in stabilizing the connection during longer operations.\n\n2. `wait_timeout` - This parameter defines the amount of time that MySQL will wait before closing an idle connection. Adjusting this might help in scenarios where connections are intermittently idle and being closed prematurely.\n\n3. `interactive_timeout` - Similar to `wait_timeout`, but specifically for interactive sessions. Adjusting this could be beneficial if the application maintains interactive MySQL sessions.\n\nGiven the context and the specific adjustments that led to a resolution, the recommended parameters to consider are:\n\n```plaintext\n['connect_timeout', 'wait_timeout', 'interactive_timeout']\n```"}
