{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the issues related to character encoding mismatches between the database and the PHP output, the recommended parameters to focus on would be:\n\n['character_set_connection', 'character_set_results', 'character_set_client'] \n\nThese parameters ensure that the connection, the results retrieved from the database, and the client handling the data are all using consistent character encoding, which in this case should be UTF-8 to match your HTML header's charset specification. Adjusting these settings will help ensure that the data is handled correctly throughout the process from retrieval to display."}
