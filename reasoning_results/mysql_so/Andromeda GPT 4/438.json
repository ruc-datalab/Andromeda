{"res": "Based on the provided configuration and the issues described, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your MySQL configuration to potentially improve stability and performance:\n\n1. **key_buffer_size**: Increase this value to allocate more memory to MyISAM indexes, which can improve index read performance. Given the traffic and the use of MyISAM as the default storage engine, a larger buffer may help.\n\n2. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value allows more tables to be kept open, reducing the overhead of opening tables frequently. This is particularly useful for a WordPress site with many plugins, which may involve numerous table accesses.\n\n3. **thread_cache_size**: Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. Given the traffic to your site, having more threads cached could improve responsiveness.\n\n4. **max_heap_table_size**: This parameter should be increased if temporary tables are used extensively, which is common with WordPress and WooCommerce setups. It should generally be set equal to the `tmp_table_size` to ensure that temporary tables are memory-based as long as possible.\n\n5. **tmp_table_size**: Ensure this is sufficiently large to accommodate temporary tables created during complex queries, which are common in WordPress environments. This reduces the likelihood of temporary tables being written to disk, which is slower.\n\n6. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: If you decide to use InnoDB at any point or have InnoDB tables, this should be increased to a significant portion of your available memory. Given that you have disabled InnoDB, this is not applicable unless you re-enable InnoDB.\n\n7. **query_cache_size**: Although deprecated in later versions of MySQL, if you are using MySQL 5.5 and seeing benefits from the query cache, you might consider adjusting this value. However, be cautious as the query cache can also degrade performance under certain workloads.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size**: This is used for sorting operations. Given that WordPress can involve complex queries, especially with plugins and themes that perform lots of sorting, you might benefit from increasing this slightly.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size** and **read_rnd_buffer_size**: These buffers are used for sequential and random read operations, respectively. Tuning these can help improve the read performance.\n\n10. **table_definition_cache**: Increase this to cache more table metadata, which can be beneficial for a WordPress site with many plugins and tables.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```plaintext\n['key_buffer_size', 'table_open_cache', 'thread_cache_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'query_cache_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_buffer_size', 'read_rnd_buffer_size', 'table_definition_cache']\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be tested in a staging environment before applying them to production, as the impact can vary based on specific workloads and configurations. Additionally, monitor the server's performance after making these changes to ensure they have the desired effect."}
