{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of your query regarding automatic purging of binary logs in MySQL, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n- `expire_logs_days`\n- `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the configuration of automatic purging of binary logs. Since you mentioned using MySQL 8.0.22, `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` should be the correct parameter to use, but it seems it's not having the desired effect. You might want to ensure that the configuration is correctly set in the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`) and that the server has been restarted if necessary to apply these changes.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n['expire_logs_days', 'binlog_expire_logs_seconds']\n```"}
