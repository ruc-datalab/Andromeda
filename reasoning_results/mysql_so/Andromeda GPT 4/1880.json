{"res": "Based on the scenario described and the issues you're facing with GTID replication in Percona MySQL 5.6, the following parameters and considerations are recommended to address the replication issues:\n\n1. **`slave_parallel_workers`**: Since you mentioned setting `sql_slave_parallel_workers` to 0, it's important to consider whether parallel replication is appropriate for your workload. If the workload is highly concurrent, setting `slave_parallel_workers` to a higher value might help in processing the relay logs more efficiently, but it must be managed carefully to avoid issues with transaction dependencies.\n\n2. **`slave_preserve_commit_order`**: When using parallel replication (`slave_parallel_workers > 0`), setting `slave_preserve_commit_order=1` ensures that transactions are committed on the replica in the same order as they were on the master. This can help prevent issues where out-of-order commits lead to inconsistencies or errors like the one you're experiencing.\n\n3. **`gtid_mode` and `enforce_gtid_consistency`**: Ensure that `gtid_mode=ON` and `enforce_gtid_consistency=ON` are set to enforce GTID consistency. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent replication setup and ensuring that all transactions are replicated correctly using GTIDs.\n\n4. **`relay_log_recovery`**: Since you are facing issues with GTID sequences and possible missing transactions, enabling `relay_log_recovery=ON` might help in automatically recovering from failures in the relay log, although this parameter needs careful consideration in terms of its impact on replication performance and behavior.\n\n5. **`sql_slave_skip_counter`**: Although not typically recommended because it can lead to data inconsistencies, in cases where you know exactly what transactions or events need to be skipped (and it's safe to do so), you can temporarily set `sql_slave_skip_counter` to skip over problematic events. However, this should be used with caution and ideally under the guidance of someone who fully understands the implications.\n\n6. **Manual intervention using `CHANGE MASTER TO`**: If specific transactions are known to cause issues and are safe to skip, manually adjusting the master log position using the `CHANGE MASTER TO` statement might be necessary. This involves setting the `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and `MASTER_LOG_POS` to the correct values after the problematic transaction.\n\n7. **Monitoring and diagnostics**: Regularly monitor the replication status using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` and check for any errors or warnings. Look into the `Last_SQL_Error` and `Last_IO_Error` fields to diagnose issues.\n\nGiven the complexity of replication issues, especially with GTIDs and parallel replication, it's also recommended to review the MySQL error logs and consider engaging with a MySQL consultant or expert if the problem persists or if the data integrity is critical.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your scenario:\n```plaintext\n['slave_parallel_workers', 'slave_preserve_commit_order', 'gtid_mode', 'relay_log_recovery', 'sql_slave_skip_counter']\n```"}
