{"res": "Based on the provided information and the query, it appears that the SSL/Secure connection is indeed established despite the absence of explicit SSL parameters in the command. This is confirmed by the log entry stating \"SSL enabled (protocol=TLSv1.3, cipher=TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits=256, compression=off)\" which indicates that the connection is using SSL/TLS encryption.\n\nThe fact that the `pg_restore` command succeeded without explicitly setting SSL mode suggests that the server (in this case, Azure PostgreSQL) might be configured to require secure (encrypted) connections by default. This could be enforced by the server configuration, possibly using parameters like `require_secure_transport` which mandates encrypted connections.\n\nGiven the context and the details from the documentation excerpts provided, the relevant parameters to consider in this scenario are:\n- `require_secure_transport`: This parameter ensures that the server requires encrypted connections, which aligns with the behavior observed in the log where SSL is enabled despite no explicit SSL parameters in the command.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter based on the query and the documentation provided is:\n```json\n['require_secure_transport']\n```"}
