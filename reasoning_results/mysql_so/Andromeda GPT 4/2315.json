{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the issues you're facing with nightly updates and the server crash logs, it seems that the problem might be related to InnoDB's handling of concurrent operations and its buffer management. Here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your MySQL configuration to potentially alleviate these issues:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Since you have a large buffer pool size already (53G), ensure that this is appropriate relative to your total system memory. If your system has more memory available, consider increasing this value to reduce disk I/O by keeping more data in memory.\n\n2. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing this from 4M might help reduce disk I/O for log writes during heavy transactional activity. Consider setting this to a higher value like 16M or 32M.\n\n3. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This is set to 0, which can improve performance but at the risk of losing up to one second of transactions in a crash. For critical systems, a value of 1 is safer, ensuring log is flushed to disk at each transaction commit.\n\n4. **innodb_log_file_size**: Ensure that the log file size is sufficient to hold about an hour's worth of changes. If 25G seems too large and might be causing long recovery times, consider reducing it based on your system's workload.\n\n5. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter can be used to limit the number of concurrently executing threads within InnoDB, which might help manage contention during high concurrency. Experiment with values like 8, 16, or 32 depending on your CPU cores.\n\n6. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjust these parameters based on your system's I/O capability. They control the background I/O rate for InnoDB. Setting these appropriately can help balance foreground activity and background maintenance work.\n\n7. **innodb_adaptive_hash_index**: You've disabled this, which might help with specific workloads. Monitor performance to see if this change positively impacts your system.\n\n8. **innodb_flush_method**: Setting this to `O_DIRECT` can reduce I/O swamping by bypassing the operating system's buffer cache for data files. This is particularly useful on systems with a dedicated database storage subsystem.\n\n9. **thread_cache_size**: Increase this value to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads. A larger cache can be beneficial if your workload involves many short connections.\n\n10. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of opening and closing tables, which is beneficial if your workload accesses many different tables.\n\nGiven your scenario, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit', 'innodb_log_file_size', 'innodb_thread_concurrency', 'innodb_io_capacity', 'innodb_io_capacity_max', 'innodb_adaptive_hash_index', 'innodb_flush_method', 'thread_cache_size', 'table_open_cache']\n```"}
