{"res": "Based on the error message you encountered and the context of your query, the relevant parameter to adjust in your MySQL configuration would be:\n\n['max_binlog_cache_size']\n\nThis parameter needs to be increased to accommodate the size of the transaction you are trying to process with the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command. Adjusting this parameter should help resolve the error related to the transaction requiring more storage than currently allowed by `max_binlog_cache_size`."}
