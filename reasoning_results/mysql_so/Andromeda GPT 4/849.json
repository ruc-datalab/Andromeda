{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described, the key parameter that needs to be addressed to resolve your issue with using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` from PHP is `local_infile`. This parameter needs to be enabled on both the MySQL server side and within the PHP environment. Since you've confirmed that `mysql.allow_local_infile = On` in PHP and you've been able to use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` from the MySQL command line with `--local_infile=1`, the issue seems to be with how the MySQL server is handling these requests when initiated from PHP.\n\nGiven that you are moving to an Amazon RDS instance, you should ensure that the RDS instance has the `local_infile` parameter set to `1` (enabled). This can be configured in the RDS parameter group associated with your MySQL instance.\n\nHere are the recommended parameters to focus on:\n\n- `local_infile`\n\nEnsure this parameter is enabled on your MySQL server (or RDS instance) and confirm that your PHP configuration allows for local infile operations. This should help in resolving the issue you're facing with PHP's `mysql_connect` function when trying to execute `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.\n\nOutput the list as requested:\n\n```json\n[\"local_infile\"]\n```"}
