{"res": "Based on the problem described where you can connect to the MySQL server both with SSL and without SSL, despite specifying `REQUIRE SSL` for the user, it seems there might be a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of how SSL requirements are enforced at the server level.\n\nTo ensure that all client connections to the MySQL server use secure transport (SSL), you can enforce this at the server level by setting the `require_secure_transport` parameter to `ON`. This parameter ensures that MySQL does not accept any connections that are not encrypted. Here's the recommended parameter based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\"require_secure_transport\"]\n``` \n\nSetting this parameter will help in restricting non-SSL connections to the MySQL server, aligning with the security practices you intended to enforce by using `REQUIRE SSL` at the user level."}
