{"res": "Based on the detailed information provided and the issues described, the following parameters are recommended to potentially improve MySQL performance and address the high CPU usage and performance degradation after upgrading to MySQL 8.0:\n\n1. `innodb_buffer_pool_size` - Increasing this value can help utilize more RAM for caching InnoDB tables and reduce disk I/O, which is beneficial especially on a system with 16GB of RAM. Given the upgrade and the performance issues, ensuring this is set to a value like 8G (as already set) or even higher if the workload is heavily InnoDB-based could be beneficial.\n\n2. `innodb_log_file_size` - This should be set to about 25% of the `innodb_buffer_pool_size`. If `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is increased, consider adjusting this accordingly.\n\n3. `innodb_read_io_threads` and `innodb_write_io_threads` - These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations in InnoDB. Increasing these values can improve I/O throughput, especially on a server with multiple cores and high disk I/O.\n\n4. `innodb_thread_concurrency` - This parameter can be adjusted to control the number of threads that InnoDB can use concurrently. The current setting seems high, and tuning it based on the actual CPU and workload might help.\n\n5. `max_connections` - Given the high `max_connections` setting (1000), it's crucial to ensure that the server isn't overwhelmed by too many connections at once, which can lead to high CPU usage. Consider adjusting this based on the typical number of concurrent connections.\n\n6. `thread_cache_size` - This parameter helps by reducing the overhead of creating new connections. Adjusting this value can help manage connection overhead better.\n\n7. `query_cache_size` and `query_cache_type` - Since MySQL 8.0, the query cache is deprecated. If upgrading from a version where the query cache was used, it's important to note that performance might be affected due to this change. Relying on other performance optimizations is necessary.\n\n8. `table_open_cache` - Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of opening tables, which is beneficial if your application accesses many different tables.\n\n9. `tmp_table_size` and `max_heap_table_size` - These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables excessively might require adjustments to these values.\n\n10. `sort_buffer_size`, `read_buffer_size`, `read_rnd_buffer_size` - These per-session buffer sizes can be adjusted based on the workload. If queries involve sorting and reading large datasets, tuning these buffers might help.\n\nGiven the complexity of MySQL performance tuning and the variability of workloads, it's recommended to make changes incrementally and monitor the impact on performance through tools like `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;`, `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;`, and other monitoring tools.\n\nRecommended parameters based on the issues described and the provided configuration:\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\"\n]\n```"}
