{"res": "Based on the information provided and the error encountered when trying to connect to MySQL using Python, it appears that the issue might be related to SSL configuration, similar to what was necessary in JavaScript. Since the database is hosted on AWS RDS and the connection works with SSL specified in JavaScript, it's likely that specifying SSL parameters in the Python connection might resolve the issue. However, the provided manuals and previous questions do not directly mention SSL-related parameters. Therefore, I recommend checking the MySQL and mysql.connector documentation for the correct SSL parameters to use in Python.\n\nRecommended parameters based on the context and previous examples might include:\n- `ssl_ca`\n- `ssl_cert`\n- `ssl_key`\n\nThese parameters are typically used to configure SSL connections in Python's MySQL connector but were not explicitly listed in the provided documentation excerpts. You should verify and use the appropriate SSL parameters as per the mysql.connector documentation.\n\nOutput list (based on typical SSL parameters for Python MySQL connections, not directly from the provided manuals):\n```plaintext\n['ssl_ca', 'ssl_cert', 'ssl_key']\n```"}
