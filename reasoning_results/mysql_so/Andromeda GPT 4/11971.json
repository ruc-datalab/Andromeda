{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the nature of the operations being performed in the stored procedure, the following parameters could potentially help in optimizing the performance:\n\n1. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`** - This parameter is crucial for InnoDB performance as it defines the amount of memory allocated to InnoDB for caching data and indexes. Increasing this size can help reduce disk I/O by keeping more data in memory, especially beneficial if your temporary tables and operations are I/O intensive.\n\n2. **`tmp_table_size`** and **`max_heap_table_size`** - These parameters determine the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. If exceeded, MySQL will convert the in-memory temporary tables to on-disk tables. Increasing these values might help if your temporary tables are becoming too large to be held in memory.\n\n3. **`read_buffer_size`** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer that is allocated for reading rows from MyISAM tables. If your temporary tables or operations involve a lot of row scanning, adjusting this might yield performance benefits.\n\n4. **`sort_buffer_size`** - This parameter is used for sorting operations. If your queries involve sorting, increasing this buffer size might improve the performance of those operations.\n\nGiven the operations described in your stored procedure, these parameters are the most relevant to consider for tuning. Adjusting them should be done cautiously and typically in small increments, observing the impact on performance with each change.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'read_buffer_size', 'sort_buffer_size']\n```"}
