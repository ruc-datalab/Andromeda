{"res": "Based on the scenario described where tables need to be converted from MyISAM to InnoDB but are defaulting to MyISAM, and considering the parameters discussed in the reference questions, the recommended parameters to address this issue would be:\n\n- `default_storage_engine`\n- `foreign_key_checks`\n- `sql_mode`\n\nThese parameters are relevant because:\n\n1. `default_storage_engine`: This parameter will ensure that when tables are created without specifying the engine, they default to InnoDB, which is required for Magento for transaction support and foreign key constraints.\n\n2. `foreign_key_checks`: Temporarily disabling this during the conversion process can help avoid issues related to foreign key constraints, which might block the engine conversion if there are dependencies.\n\n3. `sql_mode`: Adjusting SQL mode can help avoid issues with strict SQL syntax that might be causing problems during the conversion or recreation of tables.\n\nThus, the output list of recommended parameters would be:\n\n```json\n['default_storage_engine', 'foreign_key_checks', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
