{"res": "To address your requirement of clearing the entire InnoDB buffer pool to ensure both queries start from the same baseline without restarting the MySQL server, you can use the following parameter:\n\n- `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`\n\nThis parameter allows you to configure the percentage of the most-recently-used pages in the buffer pool that you want to dump. Setting this parameter to 0 and then triggering a buffer pool dump would effectively clear the buffer pool, allowing you to run your queries from a clean state.\n\nHere is the recommended parameter list based on your query:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct']\n```"}
