{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you are encountering with MariaDB setup regarding the `innodb_large_prefix` and related settings, the parameters you should focus on are:\n\n- `innodb_large_prefix`\n- `innodb_file_per_table`\n- `innodb_file_format`\n\nThese parameters are crucial for enabling larger index key prefixes, which is necessary when dealing with utf8mb4 character encoding where each character can take up to 4 bytes. The `innodb_large_prefix` allows for longer key prefixes, `innodb_file_per_table` ensures that each table has its own .ibd file which is required for the `barracuda` file format, and `innodb_file_format` set to `barracuda` allows for this functionality.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters:\n\n```json\n['innodb_large_prefix', 'innodb_file_per_table', 'innodb_file_format']\n```"}
