{"res": "Yes, the current development of InnoDB does take into consideration the use of SSD drives. The configuration options available allow for tuning performance specifically for SSDs. Based on the documentation provided and the context of your query, the relevant parameters for tuning InnoDB performance for SSD drives are:\n\n- `innodb_io_capacity`\n- `innodb_io_capacity_max`\n\nThese parameters allow you to specify the I/O capacity of the storage device, which is crucial for optimizing performance on SSDs compared to traditional spindle hard drives.\n\nRecommended parameters list: `['innodb_io_capacity', 'innodb_io_capacity_max']`"}
