{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described and the errors encountered during the setup of MySQL Group Replication, it appears that the issues are related to the configuration of the group communication system. The errors specifically mention a timeout while waiting for the group communication engine to be ready and that the engine is not ready for the member to join. This suggests potential misconfigurations in the parameters that handle group communication settings.\n\nThe relevant parameters from the documentation and your configuration that could influence this behavior are:\n\n1. `group_replication_local_address` - This parameter specifies the local address that the group replication subsystem will use for group communication. It should be set to an address and port that other group members can reach.\n\n2. `group_replication_group_seeds` - This parameter lists the group replication communication endpoints that are used by group members to connect to each other. It should include the `group_replication_local_address` of all members.\n\n3. `group_replication_ip_whitelist` - This parameter specifies which hosts are allowed to connect to the group replication plugin. It should include the private IP addresses of all servers that are part of the replication group.\n\nGiven the errors and the configuration details you've provided, I recommend reviewing and possibly adjusting the following parameters:\n\n- `group_replication_local_address`\n- `group_replication_group_seeds`\n- `group_replication_ip_whitelist`\n\nThese parameters are crucial for ensuring that the group communication subsystem is correctly configured and that all nodes can successfully connect and communicate with each other within the replication group.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to focus on are:\n\n```json\n[\"group_replication_local_address\", \"group_replication_group_seeds\", \"group_replication_ip_whitelist\"]\n```"}
