{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query about MySQL crashes and the mixture of table types in your database, the relevant database parameters to consider would be:\n\n1. `default_storage_engine` - This parameter is crucial because it determines the storage engine used when tables are created. If your database has a mixture of table types, it might be due to tables being created with different storage engines at different times or under different configurations. Setting a consistent `default_storage_engine` could help standardize new table creations and possibly reduce issues related to having multiple storage engines.\n\n2. `innodb_file_per_table` - This parameter decides whether InnoDB tables are stored in the shared system tablespace or in separate files (one file per table). If you are experiencing crashes and have a mix of table types, adjusting this parameter might help in managing how InnoDB tables are stored, potentially affecting performance and recovery characteristics.\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the management and behavior of table storage and engine types in MySQL, which seems to be at the core of the issues you're experiencing with the database crashes and mixed table types.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['default_storage_engine', 'innodb_file_per_table']\n```"}
