{"res": "Based on the issues described in your query, where you are facing an \"Access denied for user 'root@localhost' (using password: NO)\" error when trying to run `rails db:migrate`, it seems that the problem is related to how your application is configured to connect to MySQL. The error suggests that the password is either not being sent correctly or not configured at all in your database configuration file for your Ruby on Rails project.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the error, the relevant parameters to look into would be:\n\n- `socket`: This parameter specifies the Unix socket file used for local connections to MySQL, which can be crucial if your Rails application is configured to connect through a socket.\n- `port`: This parameter specifies the port number that the MySQL server is listening on, which is important if your Rails application is trying to connect over TCP/IP instead of a Unix socket.\n\nThese parameters are often critical when configuring database connections in a development environment, especially when dealing with permission issues or when the application fails to connect to the MySQL server.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to check and potentially adjust in your Ruby on Rails database configuration are:\n\n```json\n[\"socket\", \"port\"]\n```"}
