{"res": "Based on the scenario described where the console freezes during the import of a MySQL script, and considering the parameters discussed in the reference questions, the most relevant parameters to recommend would be:\n\n- `max_allowed_packet`: This parameter could be relevant if the SQL file contains very large queries that exceed the default packet size, which might cause issues during import.\n- `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: Increasing this parameter might help in speeding up the import process if the database is using the InnoDB engine, as it allows more data to be stored in memory.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n['max_allowed_packet', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size']\n```"}
