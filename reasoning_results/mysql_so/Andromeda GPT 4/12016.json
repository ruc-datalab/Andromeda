{"res": "Based on the scenario described where MySQL is consuming a significant amount of memory while idling on a fresh XAMPP installation, the following parameters could be adjusted to optimize memory usage:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. Reducing this size can decrease the memory footprint if the default value is too high for your needs.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter is used for caching MyISAM indexes. If you are not using MyISAM tables extensively or at all (which is common as InnoDB is the default engine), you can reduce this size to free up memory.\n\n3. **max_connections** - This parameter determines the maximum number of simultaneous client connections. If set too high, MySQL reserves more memory for these connections than might be necessary. Adjusting this to a lower number based on actual usage can reduce memory usage.\n\n4. **thread_cache_size** - This parameter sets the number of threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many already there. Reducing this number can lower memory usage, especially if the server isn't under heavy load.\n\n5. **query_cache_size** (if applicable) - This parameter specifies the amount of memory allocated for caching query results. Note that the query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0. If using an earlier version, adjusting this might help, but it's recommended to disable the query cache by setting it to 0 for performance reasons in most scenarios.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their direct impact on memory usage and the description of the issue. Adjusting these should help manage the memory consumption of MySQL under the conditions described.\n\nOutputting the list as requested:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'max_connections', 'thread_cache_size']\n```"}
