{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you are facing with the MySQL password validation plugin, the following parameters from the documentation and your current settings are relevant to address the problem:\n\n1. **validate_password_policy**: This parameter defines the strength of the password policy (LOW, MEDIUM, STRONG). You mentioned trying to change this to LOW, but it didn't resolve the issue. It might be worth revisiting or ensuring the change was applied correctly.\n\n2. **validate_password_length**: This parameter sets the minimum length of the password. Your current setting is 8, which should be sufficient for MEDIUM policy, but it's good to confirm if this setting aligns with other password requirements.\n\n3. **validate_password_check_user_name**: This parameter is set to ON, which means the password cannot contain the username. Ensure that the passwords you are trying do not include any part of the username.\n\nGiven the error and the settings you've tried, these parameters are the most relevant to troubleshoot and adjust to meet the MySQL password policy requirements. Here is the list of recommended parameters to review and potentially adjust:\n\n```json\n['validate_password_policy', 'validate_password_length', 'validate_password_check_user_name']\n```"}
