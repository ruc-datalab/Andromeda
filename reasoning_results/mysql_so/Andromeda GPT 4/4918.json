{"res": "Based on the error message you received (\"ERROR: cannot execute CREATE SCHEMA in a read-only transaction\") and the context of your query, it seems that your PostgreSQL database is operating in a read-only mode. This could be due to the database's transaction mode being set to read-only.\n\nTo address this issue, you would need to change the transaction mode from read-only to read-write. The relevant parameters from the provided documentation and user questions that can help you adjust the transaction mode are:\n\n- `transaction_read_only`\n- `read_only`\n\nThese parameters can be used to control whether the database transactions are read-only or can also include write operations. Here is the recommended list of parameters to consider for your situation:\n\n```plaintext\n['transaction_read_only', 'read_only']\n```"}
