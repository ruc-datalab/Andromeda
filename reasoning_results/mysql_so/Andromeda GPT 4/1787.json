{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues described in your query, it appears that the problem with the matching score of 'a' and 'i' being 0 in your FULLTEXT search is related to the default stopword list used by the MySQL/MariaDB FULLTEXT index. The default stopword list includes common words (which in many cases include single letters like 'a' and 'i') that are omitted from the index to improve search performance and relevance.\n\nTo address this issue, you can modify the stopword list used by the FULLTEXT index. You have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Disable the use of the stopword list**: This will include all words in the index, including common words and single letters. This might decrease performance and increase index size but will allow you to search for 'a' and 'i'.\n\n2. **Customize the stopword list**: You can specify your own list of stopwords that does not include 'a' or 'i', or is more tailored to your specific use case.\n\nHere are the parameters you can adjust based on the issues and the documentation provided:\n\n- `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`: Set this to `OFF` to disable the stopword list completely.\n- `ft_stopword_file`: Specify a custom stopword file. Set this to the path of your custom stopword file if you choose to use a customized list.\n- `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`: If you prefer to manage stopwords in a database table, specify the table in the format `db_name/table_name`.\n\nGiven the context of your query and the documentation references, the recommended parameters to adjust are:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_ft_enable_stopword\", \"ft_stopword_file\", \"innodb_ft_server_stopword_table\"]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help resolve the issue with the FULLTEXT search not returning expected results for single letters like 'a' and 'i'."}
