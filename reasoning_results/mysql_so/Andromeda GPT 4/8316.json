{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described, where there is a significant discrepancy between the data written to the database and the disk activity reported by various monitoring tools, it seems that the issue might be related to how MySQL handles I/O operations, particularly during bursts of activity such as data loading. The parameters that could be influential in this context, considering the information provided in the manuals and the nature of your issue, are:\n\n1. **innodb_io_capacity**: This parameter specifies the number of I/O operations per second that InnoDB can perform. It is crucial for controlling disk I/O activity and can be adjusted to better align with your system's capabilities and workload characteristics.\n\n2. **innodb_flush_sync**: As per the manual, when enabled (which is the default), this setting causes the `innodb_io_capacity` setting to be ignored during bursts of I/O activity that occur at checkpoints. Disabling `innodb_flush_sync` might help in adhering to the I/O rate defined by `innodb_io_capacity`, potentially reducing the discrepancy in reported disk activity.\n\nGiven the nature of your issue with the apparent excessive writing compared to the actual data size, adjusting these parameters might help in managing the I/O behavior more effectively:\n\n- **innodb_io_capacity**: Increase or adjust this setting based on your disk's capabilities and the observed I/O load.\n- **innodb_flush_sync**: Consider disabling this to enforce the `innodb_io_capacity` limits during checkpointing.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_io_capacity', 'innodb_flush_sync']\n```"}
