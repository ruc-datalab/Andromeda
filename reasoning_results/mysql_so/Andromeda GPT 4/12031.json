{"res": "Based on the query performance issue described with the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.key_column_usage` table in MySQL version 5.5.11, and considering the nature of the query and the database system involved, the most relevant parameters to adjust would be those that can potentially improve the performance of metadata operations and general query performance. \n\nGiven the details provided and the parameters discussed in the manuals and previous user questions, the following parameters are recommended:\n\n1. **table_open_cache** - This parameter determines the number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value can help if your query involves a lot of table opening and closing, which is common when querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.\n\n2. **tmp_table_size** - This parameter specifies the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Although your query does not explicitly create temporary tables, MySQL might use them implicitly for operations on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.\n\n3. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter is crucial for overall InnoDB performance, affecting how much data can be buffered in memory. It might not directly impact the performance of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries, but increasing it can improve the overall performance of the database, potentially reducing the load and allowing system tables to be accessed more quickly.\n\n4. **optimizer_search_depth** - This parameter controls the depth of search for the best execution plan in the query optimizer. Adjusting it might influence how MySQL optimizes queries on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, although its impact might be limited in this context.\n\nGiven the nature of your query and the typical performance considerations for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, these parameters are the most likely candidates to help improve performance:\n\n```json\n['table_open_cache', 'tmp_table_size', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'optimizer_search_depth']\n```"}
