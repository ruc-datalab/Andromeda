{"res": "Based on the provided information and the context of your query regarding the large binary log files (`mysql-bin.xxxxxx`) found in `/var/log/mysql`, and noting that you do not use replication for your database, the appropriate action would be to manage these binary log files to prevent them from consuming unnecessary disk space.\n\nSince you are not using replication, these binary log files are not required for the purpose of data recovery or synchronization across replicas. However, directly deleting these files is not recommended as it could potentially disrupt MySQL's ability to track and manage these logs.\n\nThe recommended parameter to address this issue is:\n\n- `expire_logs_days`: This parameter in MySQL is used to automatically purge old binary logs after a certain number of days. Setting this parameter can help manage disk space by automatically removing outdated binary logs.\n\n- `log_bin`: You might consider disabling binary logging if it's not needed (since you mentioned not using replication). This would prevent the creation of new binary log files. However, this should be done with caution and understanding of the implications, as binary logs are also useful for point-in-time recovery.\n\nGiven that you are not using replication, here are the recommended parameters:\n\n```json\n[\"expire_logs_days\", \"log_bin\"]\n```\n\nThese settings should be adjusted in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), and the MySQL server should be restarted for changes to take effect. Always ensure to back up your configuration and understand the changes you are making to avoid unintended consequences."}
