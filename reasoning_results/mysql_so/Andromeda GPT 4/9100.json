{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the reference to the use of MyISAM engine for handling large SQL file insertions, the following parameters from the provided documentation and user questions seem relevant to address the issues you are facing with varying performance:\n\n1. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter is crucial for MyISAM tables as it determines the amount of memory allocated for caching index blocks. Increasing this might help in speeding up index-related operations during inserts.\n\n2. **myisam_sort_buffer_size** - Since you are dealing with large inserts and possibly re-enabling keys, this buffer size can impact the performance of sorting operations which are part of rebuilding indexes.\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the performance characteristics of MyISAM tables and should be tuned considering the size of your data and the server's memory capacity.\n\nOutput list: ['key_buffer_size', 'myisam_sort_buffer_size']"}
