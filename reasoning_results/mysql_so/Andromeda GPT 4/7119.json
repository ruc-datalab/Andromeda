{"res": "Based on the issues described in your scenario, where one server was unable to recover its ONLINE status due to an error connecting to a donor server, and the other servers were unable to join the group successfully, the following parameters from the provided documentation are relevant to address the problems:\n\n1. **group_replication_recovery_reconnect_interval** - This parameter can be adjusted to modify the interval between donor connection attempts during the recovery process. Since there was an error connecting to the master and the default retry interval is 60 seconds, adjusting this parameter might help in stabilizing the connection attempts and potentially resolving the connectivity issues.\n\n2. **group_replication_bootstrap_group** - Since you re-initialized group replication on all 3 servers and bootstrapped the replication list on the first server, it's crucial to ensure that this parameter is set to 'off' on the other servers after the first server comes online. This prevents multiple bootstrapping which can lead to issues like split-brain scenarios.\n\nGiven the details of the error and the recovery issues faced by the other servers, these parameters are critical to address the described problems:\n\n```json\n['group_replication_recovery_reconnect_interval', 'group_replication_bootstrap_group']\n```"}
