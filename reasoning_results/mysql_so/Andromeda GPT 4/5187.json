{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described, where the initial query execution is significantly slower than subsequent executions, it seems that the issue is related to caching and the time it takes to load data into the cache. Given the nature of the problem and the information provided, here are the recommended parameters to adjust in your MySQL configuration to potentially improve the performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter can help by caching more data from your InnoDB tables, reducing the need to read from disk on subsequent queries. Since you're experiencing a slowdown on the first query after a period of inactivity, it's likely that data is being evicted from the buffer pool. A larger buffer pool can mitigate this.\n\n2. **query_cache_type** and **query_cache_size**: Although deprecated in later versions of MySQL, since you are using MySQL 5.6, adjusting these might help if they are not already maximized. Enabling the query cache can reduce the time taken for subsequent executions of the same query by serving results from the cache. However, be cautious as the query cache can also reduce performance under high concurrency or if the query patterns are highly dynamic.\n\n3. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables for sorting or subqueries might benefit from larger temporary tables, reducing the need to write to disk-based temporary tables.\n\n4. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing this parameter can reduce disk I/O by allowing more data to be held in the log buffer before being written to the log file. This is particularly useful for write-heavy loads but can also benefit read-write mixed workloads during complex query operations.\n\n5. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations in InnoDB. Increasing these values can improve I/O throughput, especially on systems with SSDs or multiple disks.\n\nGiven your specific case, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'query_cache_type', 'query_cache_size', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'innodb_read_io_threads', 'innodb_write_io_threads']\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help mitigate the initial slow query performance by optimizing how data is cached and how I/O operations are handled. Always ensure to monitor the system's performance after making these changes to validate their impact."}
