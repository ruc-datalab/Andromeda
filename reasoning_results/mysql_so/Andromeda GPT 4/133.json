{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where you are dealing with a MyISAM storage engine and performing an operation to add an index to a large table, the following parameters from the provided documentation and previous context are relevant to optimize the performance:\n\n1. **myisam_max_sort_file_size**: This parameter controls the maximum size of the temporary file MyISAM is allowed to use while recreating indexes during REPAIR, ALTER, or LOAD DATA INFILE operations. Increasing this size can allow the operation to complete faster if the temporary file fits within this limit.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size**: This parameter is crucial for MyISAM tables as it specifies the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Increasing this size can improve index read operations, which is critical when adding an index.\n\n3. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter determines the size of the buffer that is allocated when sorting MyISAM indexes during the creation of an index. A larger buffer can speed up the sorting process during index creation.\n\n4. **read_buffer_size**: This parameter affects the speed of reading rows from MyISAM tables during sequential scans, which can indirectly influence the performance of index creation by speeding up the table scan phase.\n\n5. **open_files_limit**: This parameter sets the maximum number of file handles that MySQL can open. Since MyISAM requires a separate file for each table and index, ensuring this value is high enough is essential to avoid file opening errors during extensive operations like index creation.\n\nGiven the details of your setup and the specific operation of adding an index to a MyISAM table, these parameters are the most directly relevant to potentially improving the performance of the operation described.\n\nOutputting the list as requested:\n\n```json\n['myisam_max_sort_file_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_buffer_size', 'open_files_limit']\n```"}
