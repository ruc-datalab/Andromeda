{"res": "Based on the provided information and the error encountered during the import of the mysqlbinlog, the issue seems to be related to the handling of NULL values for the TIMESTAMP field `DateReceived` which is declared as NOT NULL with a default value of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. The error occurs because the binlog tries to insert a NULL value into this NOT NULL field.\n\nFrom the documentation and the nature of the problem, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n1. `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp` - This parameter affects the behavior of TIMESTAMP columns regarding NULL values and default values. If enabled, it requires explicit declaration to allow NULL values in TIMESTAMP columns.\n\n2. `sql_mode` - This parameter includes settings that can enforce strict SQL mode which affects how MySQL handles invalid or missing values in data-change statements and can cause operations to abort on errors like trying to insert NULL into a NOT NULL column.\n\nGiven the scenario and the error message, the recommended parameters to consider adjusting are:\n\n- `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`\n- `sql_mode`\n\nThese parameters should be reviewed and configured appropriately to ensure that the TIMESTAMP columns handle NULL values as expected during the import process. Adjusting these settings may help resolve the issue encountered with the mysqlbinlog import.\n\nTherefore, the output list of recommended parameters is:\n\n```json\n[\"explicit_defaults_for_timestamp\", \"sql_mode\"]\n```"}
