{"res": "Based on the information provided and the user's need to view MySQL query errors and warnings in RDS using MySQL 5.6, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n\n1. `log_warnings` - This parameter is already set to 1, which typically logs warnings but might not be sufficient for capturing all desired error details.\n2. `log_error_verbosity` - This parameter controls the verbosity of the error log and can help in adjusting the level of detail for error messages, warnings, and notes. Since the user is upgrading to MySQL 5.7, where `log_error_verbosity` is preferred over `log_warnings`, it's relevant to consider this parameter for future configurations.\n\nGiven the user's scenario and the need to capture more detailed information about errors and warnings, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n['log_warnings', 'log_error_verbosity']\n```"}
