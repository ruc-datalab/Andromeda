{"res": "The error you're seeing in your MySQL logs indicates an issue with the size of a row in a temporary table exceeding the maximum allowed size for a record on an index leaf page. This is related to the internal workings of MySQL, specifically when handling temporary tables during operations like `ALTER TABLE`.\n\nThe `tmp` database mentioned in the error message is indeed an internal MySQL structure used for temporary tables. While this is managed internally by MySQL, it's something you should be aware of because it can affect the performance and success of database operations, particularly those involving large datasets or complex alterations.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider adjusting the following parameters to manage the size and behavior of temporary tables and their storage:\n\n1. **innodb_tmpdir** - This parameter specifies the directory location for temporary table files created during online `ALTER TABLE` operations. Adjusting this might help manage where large temporary files are stored, potentially avoiding file system limitations.\n\n2. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables before they are converted to on-disk tables. Increasing these values might prevent the conversion to on-disk format, which could potentially help with performance but be cautious as setting these too high can consume excessive memory.\n\n3. **internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine** - This parameter defines the storage engine used for on-disk temporary tables. Depending on the operations and the specific performance characteristics of different storage engines, adjusting this might help optimize performance.\n\nGiven the nature of your error, focusing on how MySQL handles temporary tables and their size limits would be beneficial. Here are the recommended parameters to consider adjusting:\n\n```json\n['innodb_tmpdir', 'tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size', 'internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine']\n```"}
