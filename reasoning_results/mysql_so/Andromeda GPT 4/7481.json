{"res": "Based on the provided scenario where MySQL is returning an \"Out of memory\" error during a simple query on a large table, and considering the server has a substantial amount of RAM (64GB) dedicated to MySQL, the following parameters should be reviewed and potentially adjusted to optimize performance and address memory issues:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter is crucial for InnoDB performance as it defines the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Given the large dataset and the substantial amount of dedicated RAM, increasing this value could help. Since 40GB is dedicated to MySQL, setting this to a higher value close to the dedicated amount (e.g., 30GB or more) could be beneficial.\n\n2. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the amount of memory allocated to each thread for sorting data during queries. Increasing this might help in operations that involve sorting, like the `LIKE` query mentioned.\n\n3. **read_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the buffer size for sequential table scans, which seems relevant to your query pattern. Increasing it might improve the performance of full table scans.\n\n4. **join_buffer_size**: If your queries involve joins that are not using indexes effectively, increasing this size allows more data to be stored in memory during joins, which can reduce disk I/O.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter defines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. As the server has a high number of cores and potentially high concurrency, ensuring this value is sufficiently high can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.\n\n6. **max_connections**: Given the error and the large dataset, it's possible that too many connections are exhausting available memory. Reviewing whether all these connections are necessary or optimizing the application to use fewer connections might help.\n\n7. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables and maximum size that user-created memory tables can grow to, respectively. Queries that involve complex sorting and grouping might benefit from larger temporary tables kept in memory.\n\nGiven the details and the focus on addressing memory issues specifically related to the query and table size, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be tested in a controlled environment before being deployed in production to ensure they have the desired effect without negatively impacting other operations."}
