{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where you are dealing with data from two different time zones and using PHP to handle time zone settings, the key MySQL parameter to focus on is `time_zone`. This parameter allows you to set the time zone for the MySQL server session, which affects how TIMESTAMP values are stored and retrieved.\n\nIn your case, since PHP scripts are setting the time zone dynamically (`date_default_timezone_set(\"America/New_York\")`), it's crucial to ensure that MySQL's time zone setting aligns with the expectations of your application. If the MySQL server's time zone is not explicitly set, it will use the system's time zone by default, which might not reflect the time zone adjustments made in your PHP scripts.\n\nTo address the issue you're experiencing (no three-hour difference in the times displayed), you should consider explicitly setting the `time_zone` parameter in your MySQL session to match the time zone set in your PHP script. This can be done by executing the following SQL command at the beginning of your session:\n\n```sql\nSET time_zone = 'America/New_York';\n```\n\nOr, if dealing with multiple time zones dynamically:\n\n```sql\nSET time_zone = @@session.time_zone;\n```\n\nThis ensures that MySQL processes the TIMESTAMP data using the correct time zone context.\n\nRecommended parameters for your scenario are:\n\n```json\n[\"time_zone\"]\n```"}
