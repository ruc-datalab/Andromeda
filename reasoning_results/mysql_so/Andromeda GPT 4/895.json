{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the error logs indicating issues with `max_open_files` and `table_open_cache`, the relevant parameters to consider adjusting are:\n\n- `open_files_limit`: This parameter directly relates to the `max_open_files` warning in your error log. It sets the limit for the number of file descriptors that the MySQL server can open.\n\n- `table_open_cache`: This parameter is linked to the warning about `table_open_cache` limits being changed. It determines the number of open tables for all threads.\n\nThese parameters are likely the ones you need to adjust to address the warnings in your MySQL error logs. Here is the recommended output:\n\n```json\n['open_files_limit', 'table_open_cache']\n```"}
