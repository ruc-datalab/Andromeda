{"res": "Based on the provided configuration and the need to optimize MySQL for high CPU utilization, here are the recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter is crucial for systems using InnoDB as it defines the size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. Increasing this value can significantly reduce I/O by keeping more data in memory, especially if your dataset is larger than the current size of the buffer pool.\n\n2. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter determines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put into the cache if there aren't too many already there. A larger value can reduce the amount of time spent on thread creation and destruction, which can be CPU intensive.\n\n3. **max_connections**: High values for `max_connections` can lead to high memory and CPU usage if too many connections are being used at once. It might be beneficial to limit this to a lower number to ensure that each connection gets adequate CPU and memory resources.\n\n4. **tmp_table_size**: This parameter specifies the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. MySQL will convert these in-memory tables to on-disk tables if they exceed the limit. High CPU usage can occur if too many on-disk temporary tables are created. Adjusting this value in conjunction with `max_heap_table_size` can help optimize the performance.\n\n5. **query_cache_size**: The query cache can improve performance by storing the result set of a query in the cache. However, if the server is mostly writing with few repetitive select queries, the query cache can result in a higher CPU overhead due to invalidations. Sometimes, disabling the query cache by setting `query_cache_size` to 0 can actually improve performance.\n\n6. **innodb_log_file_size**: This parameter should be large enough to hold about one hour of logs. If it's too small, it might cause additional disk I/O which can increase CPU usage due to frequent flushes.\n\n7. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter limits the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently. Setting this to a value that matches the number of CPUs can help manage thread concurrency more effectively, potentially reducing CPU contention.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the amount of memory allocated to each thread for sorting purposes. If queries involve sorting large datasets, increasing this value might help, but excessively large values can lead to high memory consumption.\n\n9. **read_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the buffer size for sequential table scans. Increasing it might improve the performance of full table scans by reducing the number of disk reads.\n\n10. **open_files_limit**: This parameter sets the number of file descriptors that MySQL can use. If you have a large number of tables, increasing this value can prevent the operating system from running out of file descriptors, especially on systems with a lot of tables or partitions.\n\nRecommended parameters to adjust based on your scenario:\n```json\n[\n  \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n  \"thread_cache_size\",\n  \"max_connections\",\n  \"tmp_table_size\",\n  \"query_cache_size\",\n  \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n  \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n  \"sort_buffer_size\",\n  \"read_buffer_size\",\n  \"open_files_limit\"\n]\n```"}
