{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the context of using Django with PostgreSQL for handling geolocation data, the following parameters are recommended:\n\n1. **ArrayField**: This parameter is crucial for handling lists of data directly in PostgreSQL, which supports array data types. It allows you to store sequences of elements in a single database field.\n\n2. **ValidationError**: This parameter is important for handling and raising errors in data validation within custom field methods. It ensures that the data conforms to expected formats or values before being processed or stored in the database.\n\nThese parameters are derived from the context of needing to handle complex data types (like geolocation data) efficiently in a Django model and ensuring data integrity through validation.\n\nOutput list: ['ArrayField', 'ValidationError']"}
