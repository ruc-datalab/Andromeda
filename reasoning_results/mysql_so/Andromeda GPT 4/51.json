{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you are facing with the MySQL Event Scheduler not starting automatically despite setting it in your configuration file, it seems there might be a syntax error or another configuration file overriding your settings.\n\nThe correct parameter to use in your `my.cnf` file should be:\n\n```plaintext\nevent_scheduler=ON\n```\n\nYou mentioned using `event-scheduler = ON`, which uses a hyphen instead of an underscore. MySQL configuration parameters use underscores, not hyphens. This could be the reason why your setting is not being recognized.\n\nTo ensure that your configuration is correct and not being overridden by another configuration file, you can check the MySQL server's current configuration by running the following command in the MySQL shell:\n\n```sql\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';\n```\n\nThis command will show you the current status of the `event_scheduler` variable. If it shows `OFF`, then your configuration setting is not being applied correctly.\n\nAdditionally, to check if another configuration file is being used, you can start your MySQL server with the `--verbose --help` options, which will output the configuration files read by the server at startup:\n\n```bash\nmysqld --verbose --help\n```\n\nLook for lines that indicate which configuration files are being read. This can help you identify if there are other configuration files that might be overriding your settings in `/etc/my.cnf`.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to ensure the Event Scheduler starts automatically is:\n\n```plaintext\n['event_scheduler']\n```"}
