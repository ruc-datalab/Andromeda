    "res": "Based on the user's request to prevent warning logs during the `LOAD DATA INFILE` operation, and considering the available parameters from the documentation and previous examples, the relevant parameters to address this issue are:\n\n- `sql_warnings`: This parameter controls whether warnings are shown for single-row `INSERT` statements. However, it might not directly affect the `LOAD DATA INFILE` operation.\n- `log_error_verbosity`: This parameter controls the verbosity of error, warning, and note messages. Setting this to a lower level can reduce the number of warning messages logged.\n\nSince the user wants to specifically prevent warning logs that might impact performance, adjusting the `log_error_verbosity` parameter seems most appropriate. Setting it to a lower level (e.g., 1) will show only errors, effectively suppressing warnings.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters are:\n```json\n['log_error_verbosity']\n```"
