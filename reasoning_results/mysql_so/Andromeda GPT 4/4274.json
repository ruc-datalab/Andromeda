{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the behavior you're observing with MySQL, it seems that the optimizer is changing its plan based on the number of values in the `IN` clause, which is affecting performance significantly. Given the MySQL version (5.7.33) and the nature of the issue, here are the recommended parameters to potentially address or mitigate the issue:\n\n1. **optimizer_switch**: This parameter allows you to control various optimizer behaviors. Since the performance changes drastically with the number of values in the `IN` clause, tweaking the optimizer strategies might help. Specifically, you might want to experiment with settings like `batched_key_access=on/off` or `mrr=on/off` to see if they influence the optimizer's decision-making process in a beneficial way.\n\n2. **max_seeks_for_key**: This parameter can influence the optimizer's decision on whether to use an index scan or a table scan. Adjusting this might help in scenarios where the number of values in the `IN` clause is large.\n\n3. **range_optimizer_max_mem_size**: This parameter controls the maximum amount of memory that can be used by the range optimizer. Since your issue arises when the `IN` clause becomes large, adjusting this parameter might help in handling larger lists more efficiently.\n\n4. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: Increasing this buffer size can improve the performance of full table scans and ordered index scans, which might be what the optimizer is falling back to when the `IN` list is very large.\n\nThese parameters are suggested based on the behavior you described and the general capabilities of MySQL to adjust query execution plans. It's important to test changes to these parameters in a development or staging environment before applying them in production, as their effects can vary significantly based on the specific workload and data distribution.\n\nRecommended parameters list: ['optimizer_switch', 'max_seeks_for_key', 'range_optimizer_max_mem_size', 'read_rnd_buffer_size']."}
