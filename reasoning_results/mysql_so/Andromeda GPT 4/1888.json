{"res": "Based on the user's specific need to suppress only the warning messages triggered by a query like `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS \"abcd\";` without affecting the logging of errors or notes, the appropriate parameter to adjust would be `sql_warnings`. This system variable controls whether warnings are generated for single-row INSERT statements, and setting it can help manage the generation of warning messages for other types of queries as well.\n\nThe `max_error_count` parameter, while mentioned, affects the storage and display of all error messages, warnings, and notes, which is broader than the user's requirement to suppress only warning messages.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to adjust in this scenario is:\n```plaintext\n['sql_warnings']\n```"}
