{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you provided and the issues you are facing with deadlocks in your PostgreSQL setup, the relevant parameters to consider adjusting or investigating further are:\n\n1. `debug_deadlocks` - This parameter can be useful for debugging deadlock issues by providing detailed information about all current locks when a deadlock timeout occurs. Enabling this could help you better understand the deadlock situation and adjust your application logic or database configuration accordingly.\n\n2. `max_locks_per_transaction` - Since your application involves locking tables and potentially many rows within those tables, increasing this parameter might help if the number of locks exceeds the default settings. This is especially relevant if your application scales up and the number of concurrent transactions increases.\n\nGiven the nature of your application and the issues described, these parameters are the most directly relevant to addressing and diagnosing the problems you're encountering with deadlocks. Here is the output list:\n\n```json\n[\"debug_deadlocks\", \"max_locks_per_transaction\"]\n```"}
