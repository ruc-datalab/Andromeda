{"res": "To address your query about blocking all connections to a specific database and closing all existing connections during schema modifications, you can use the following SQL commands in PostgreSQL. These commands will help you disconnect all existing connections and prevent new connections temporarily, which is essential during maintenance or schema updates.\n\n1. **Disconnect all existing connections to a specific database:**\n   You can use the `pg_terminate_backend()` function to terminate all connections to a specific database. Here is the SQL code to do this:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)\n   FROM pg_stat_activity\n   WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'target_database_name'\n     AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'target_database_name'` with the name of the database you want to disconnect from.\n\n2. **Block new connections to a specific database:**\n   To prevent new connections, you can alter the database to disallow new connections:\n\n   ```sql\n   ALTER DATABASE target_database_name ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = false;\n   ```\n\n   Again, replace `'target_database_name'` with the name of the database.\n\n3. **Allow new connections back to the database:**\n   Once your schema modifications are complete, you can allow new connections again by altering the database:\n\n   ```sql\n   ALTER DATABASE target_database_name ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = true;\n   ```\n\nRegarding the parameters from the provided documentation and user questions, the relevant parameters for managing connections and controlling access to the database server include:\n\n- `listen_addresses`: This parameter controls which IP addresses the server listens on; it's useful for controlling where connections can come from, especially in a multi-server environment.\n- `port`: This parameter determines the TCP/IP port the server listens on.\n\nGiven the context of your query, these parameters are relevant for understanding and controlling the broader server behavior but are not directly used in the SQL commands provided for managing connections during schema modifications. However, they are important for configuring the server's connection settings.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters based on your query and the actions you need to perform are:\n\n```json\n[\"listen_addresses\", \"port\"]\n```"}
