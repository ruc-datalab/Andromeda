{"res": "Based on the scenario described where PostgreSQL is defaulting to the lowest version when multiple versions are installed, and considering the aim to use version 13 exclusively on the standard port 5432, the relevant parameters to focus on would be:\n\n1. **port** - This parameter is crucial for defining on which TCP/IP port the server listens, which can be adjusted to ensure that PostgreSQL version 13 listens on the default port 5432.\n\n2. **listen_addresses** - This parameter specifies the IP address(es) that the server listens on; it can be set to listen on all available IP addresses or specific ones as needed.\n\nGiven the context and the need to configure PostgreSQL to use a specific version and port, these parameters are essential for achieving the desired setup.\n\nOutput list: ['port', 'listen_addresses']"}
