{"res": "Based on the detailed description and the issues you are facing with the performance of table functions in PostgreSQL, particularly the differences in execution plans between the PL/pgSQL and SQL versions of the function, the following parameters from the provided documentation and reference questions could be relevant to your situation:\n\n1. **`track_functions`** - This parameter could be useful to enable tracking of function call counts and time used, especially since you are comparing performance between different function implementations (PL/pgSQL vs SQL). Setting this to 'pl' or 'all' might help in diagnosing if there are specific overheads or performance issues directly related to the function calls themselves.\n\n2. **`enable_seqscan`** - This parameter influences the planner's use of sequential scans versus index scans. Since your query plans show differences in how scans are being utilized (e.g., sequential scans in one plan versus more optimized index scans in another), adjusting this parameter might help in forcing the planner to reconsider its path choices, potentially aligning more closely with the more efficient plan.\n\nGiven the context and the specific issues you've described, these parameters seem the most directly applicable to try and address the performance discrepancies you're observing:\n\n```json\n['track_functions', 'enable_seqscan']\n```"}
