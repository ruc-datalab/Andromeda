{"res": "Based on the information provided and the need to query the transaction isolation level of another existing session, it appears that PostgreSQL does not natively support querying session-specific settings directly using a function like `session_setting('transaction_isolation', backend_pid)`. The function `current_setting('transaction_isolation')` only retrieves the setting for the current session.\n\nHowever, you can still achieve your goal by examining the `pg_stat_activity` system view, which provides information about all active connections and their current states. This view includes the `backend_xid` and `backend_xmin` fields, which can give insights into transaction states, but it does not directly show the transaction isolation level of each session.\n\nTo address the issues with autovacuum and performance, you might consider adjusting the following parameters, although they are not directly related to querying another session's settings but could help in managing the overall database performance and behavior:\n\n1. `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` - Adjusts the fraction of table size before triggering autovacuum.\n2. `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` - Sets the minimum number of row updates before an autovacuum is triggered.\n3. `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` - The cost delay for autovacuum, which can help in throttling the autovacuum process to reduce its impact on database performance.\n4. `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` - The cost limit for autovacuum, which can be increased to allow autovacuum to work more aggressively.\n\nSince the direct querying of another session's transaction isolation level is not supported, the recommended parameters related to your query are limited to those that can help manage the performance issues you are experiencing:\n\n```json\n['autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor', 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold', 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay', 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit']\n```\n\nThese parameters do not directly solve the issue of checking the transaction isolation level of other sessions but can help in managing the autovacuum process more effectively, potentially alleviating some of the performance issues you are encountering."}
