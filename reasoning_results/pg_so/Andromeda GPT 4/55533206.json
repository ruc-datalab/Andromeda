{"res": "Based on the scenario described where you are encountering an error due to a corrupted table but wish to dump the table excluding the invalid page blocks, the most relevant parameter from the provided documentation and context is:\n\n- `zero_damaged_pages`\n\nThis parameter allows PostgreSQL to continue processing by zeroing out the damaged page in memory, which can help bypass the error caused by the corrupted data during the dump process. However, it should be used with caution as it leads to data loss for the rows on the damaged page.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to consider is:\n\n```json\n[\"zero_damaged_pages\"]\n```"}
