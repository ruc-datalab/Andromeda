{"res": "Based on the context of the error and the reference to using `heroku pg:push`, the relevant parameters to consider from the provided information are:\n\n- `search_path`\n- `port`\n\nThese parameters are related to database connection settings and schema management, which are often crucial when dealing with database operations in PostgreSQL, especially in a Heroku environment. However, the specific error mentioned (\"unrecognized data block type (0)\") suggests a possible issue with the version compatibility between `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` tools used in the local environment and on Heroku.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to focus on in this context are:\n\n```json\n[\"search_path\", \"port\"]\n```"}
