{"res": "Based on the details provided in the query and the context of the stored procedure you are auditing, the most relevant database parameter to recommend would be:\n\n['search_path']\n\nThis parameter is crucial because it influences the visibility and resolution of database objects like schemas, tables, and functions. Given that the procedure references `authors.author_id` which does not seem to exist in your database, adjusting the `search_path` might help in resolving the correct schema where the intended table or view might exist. This could potentially resolve the issue if the object exists in a schema that is not currently included in the default search path."}
