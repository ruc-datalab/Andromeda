{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues you've encountered with autovacuum not triggering as expected, it seems appropriate to recommend adjusting parameters related to vacuuming and autovacuum thresholds. Given the context of your situation and the documentation references, the following parameters are relevant:\n\n- `vacuum_freeze_table_age`\n- `vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age`\n\nThese parameters are directly related to the aggressive scanning behavior of VACUUM operations, which can help in preventing transaction ID wraparound issues and ensuring that autovacuum runs effectively before reaching critical thresholds. Adjusting these might help in maintaining better vacuuming schedules and performance.\n\nOutput list of recommended parameters:\n```plaintext\n['vacuum_freeze_table_age', 'vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age']\n```"}
