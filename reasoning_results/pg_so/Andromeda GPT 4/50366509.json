{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where you are using `COPY` to insert large batches of data into temporary tables and then manipulating and inserting that data into other tables, the following parameters from the previously mentioned ones could be relevant:\n\n1. **`fsync`** - This parameter controls whether writes are flushed to stable storage. Adjusting this could impact the performance of your bulk data operations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data and temporary tables. However, it's more critical for ensuring data durability rather than performance tuning in the context of temporary table usage.\n\n2. **`full_page_writes`** - This parameter can be relevant in scenarios where you are concerned about partial page writes, particularly after a crash. For bulk loading operations, sometimes reducing this can improve performance, but it might increase the risk of data corruption in the event of a crash.\n\n3. **`synchronous_commit`** - This parameter controls the behavior of commit operations in terms of how strictly data integrity is preserved. Turning it off can improve performance because transactions return success before their changes are written to disk, which might be useful in operations involving temporary tables where immediate durability is not a concern.\n\nGiven the specific issues you mentioned related to `pg_attribute` bloat and autovacuum performance, none of the parameters directly influence these aspects. However, adjusting `synchronous_commit` might indirectly affect the load and performance characteristics of your database operations, potentially reducing the stress on autovacuum by changing the commit behavior.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters based on your scenario and the previously discussed parameters would be:\n\n```plaintext\n['fsync', 'full_page_writes', 'synchronous_commit']\n```"}
