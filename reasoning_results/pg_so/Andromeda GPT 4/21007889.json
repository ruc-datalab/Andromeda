{"res": "Based on the scenario described where pgpool-II is incorrectly routing queries containing both read and write operations (due to the presence of CTEs with UPDATE commands), the primary concern is ensuring that write operations are not sent to read-only replicas. The documentation and parameters provided do not directly address pgpool-II's routing decisions or its ability to distinguish between read-only and write queries within a single SQL statement. However, considering the general database behavior and the parameters mentioned:\n\n1. **'in_hot_standby'** - This parameter is relevant as it indicates whether the server is in a hot standby mode (read-only). Knowing this can help understand why updates fail on a standby server.\n\n2. **'synchronous_commit'** - This parameter controls whether a commit waits for WAL records to be written to disk before succeeding, influencing the visibility and durability of a transaction. It's indirectly relevant to ensuring data consistency across primary and standby servers but does not directly impact query routing in pgpool-II.\n\nGiven the lack of a direct parameter to influence pgpool-II's routing logic in the provided documentation, the best approach might be to adjust the application or query structure rather than relying solely on database parameters. Separating the CTE that contains the UPDATE operation into a distinct transaction/query that is explicitly directed to the primary server could be a practical solution. This ensures that pgpool-II correctly routes the read-only parts of the query to the standby servers and the write operation to the primary server.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters based on the provided documentation and the context of the query issues with pgpool-II are:\n\n```json\n['in_hot_standby', 'synchronous_commit']\n```\n\nThese parameters are chosen to provide insights into the operation modes of the servers (read-only or not) and to ensure transaction visibility and consistency, which are crucial when dealing with replication and potential misrouting of queries by pgpool-II."}
