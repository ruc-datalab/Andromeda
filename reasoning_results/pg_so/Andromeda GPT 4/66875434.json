{"res": "For the query and requirement you've described, where you want to simplify the conversion of SELECT results into a JSON string format, the solution involves creating a custom function in PostgreSQL that encapsulates the logic of converting table results to JSON. This approach will help you avoid repeating the `COALESCE(jsonb_agg(tmp)::text, '[]')` pattern in multiple queries, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.\n\nGiven the context of your question and the examples provided, the relevant PostgreSQL parameters that might be involved or affected when creating and using such a function are not directly related to PostgreSQL configuration parameters like 'port' or 'search_path'. Instead, the focus is more on SQL-level constructs such as function creation and usage.\n\nHowever, if we consider the broader context of managing and optimizing the database for operations involving JSON data, you might look into parameters that affect the performance of JSON operations or the behavior of functions. But from the given examples and the nature of your query, no specific PostgreSQL \"configuration parameters\" are directly applicable to the creation and usage of a custom function for JSON formatting.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the nature of the task (which is more about SQL function usage rather than database configuration tuning), the list of relevant parameters or considerations would be empty in terms of PostgreSQL configuration parameters. If we were to consider SQL-level recommendations, it would involve advice on creating user-defined functions or using built-in JSON functions effectively.\n\nOutput list (considering the context is about configuration parameters and none are directly applicable here):\n```json\n[]\n```"}
