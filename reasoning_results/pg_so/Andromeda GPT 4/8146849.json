{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the reference to the PostgreSQL documentation, it seems that you are trying to use prepared transactions across multiple sessions initiated by separate `psql` commands. The issue you are encountering where the \"transaction-id\" is not found could indeed be due to each `psql` command initiating a new session, and thus not having access to the transaction context of the previous commands.\n\nTo address this, you need to ensure that the prepared transactions feature is enabled in PostgreSQL, as by default, it is not enabled (`max_prepared_transactions` is set to zero). You need to set this parameter to a value greater than zero to use the prepared transactions feature. This parameter can only be set at server start, so you will need to adjust your PostgreSQL configuration accordingly and restart the server.\n\nHere are the recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n- `max_prepared_transactions`: This needs to be set to a value greater than zero to enable the use of prepared transactions.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters list is:\n\n```json\n[\"max_prepared_transactions\"]\n```"}
