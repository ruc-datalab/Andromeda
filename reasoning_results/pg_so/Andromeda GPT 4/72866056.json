{"res": "Partitioning a table based on the UUID column, as described, can have varying impacts on performance depending on the nature of the queries and the database configuration. Here's an analysis for the two scenarios you've described:\n\n1. **For queries based on the UUID, returning a single row (`WHERE uuid_key = :id`)**:\n   - When querying with a specific UUID, if the partition key is well-chosen (in this case, the first 8 bits of the UUID), the database can quickly locate the correct partition out of the 256 available. This reduces the search space significantly compared to a non-partitioned table where the query would potentially scan the entire table.\n   - The effectiveness of this partitioning strategy largely depends on the database's ability to perform partition pruning, where the query planner and executor can ignore irrelevant partitions. Since all partitions are on the same physical disk, the I/O benefits might not be as significant as they would be if partitions were spread across multiple disks. However, reducing logical scanning overhead can still improve performance.\n\n2. **For other queries that must search all partitions**:\n   - For queries that do not use the partition key or need to aggregate data across all partitions, the performance might not see significant improvement. In fact, managing multiple partitions might introduce some overhead compared to a single large table, especially if the query needs to combine results from all partitions.\n   - Such queries will not benefit from partition pruning and will have to scan all partitions, potentially leading to higher computational overhead.\n\nGiven the scenario and the focus on partition pruning as a critical factor in optimizing performance for partitioned tables, the recommended database parameter based on the provided documentation is:\n\n- **`enable_partition_pruning`**: This parameter should be enabled (which is the default setting) to allow the query planner and executor to effectively eliminate irrelevant partitions during query execution. This is particularly beneficial for queries targeting specific UUIDs, as it can significantly reduce the number of partitions that need to be scanned.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter list is:\n```json\n['enable_partition_pruning']\n```"}
