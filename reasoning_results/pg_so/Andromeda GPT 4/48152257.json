{"res": "Based on the nature of your query, which involves extensive use of temporary tablespaces for handling large volumes of disk I/O, the most relevant parameter from the provided documentation and user questions is:\n\n- `temp_tablespaces`\n\nThis parameter allows you to specify tablespaces specifically for creating temporary objects and handling operations that require significant I/O, such as sorting large datasets. By configuring this parameter to use local SSDs, you can leverage their higher I/O throughput for temporary data processing, which is crucial for your use case.\n\nRecommended parameters list: ['temp_tablespaces']"}
