{"res": "Based on the issue described in your query, where PostgreSQL is not interpreting the escape sequences correctly from a MySQL dump, the relevant parameter to consider is related to how string literals and escape sequences are handled in PostgreSQL. From the provided context and typical PostgreSQL settings, the parameter that can influence this behavior is:\n\n- `standard_conforming_strings`\n\nThis parameter determines whether standard SQL string literal rules are used, where backslashes are treated as ordinary characters, or whether backslashes are treated as escape characters.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter for your issue is:\n\n```['standard_conforming_strings']```"}
