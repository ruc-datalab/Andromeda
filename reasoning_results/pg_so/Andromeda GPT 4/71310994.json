{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the connection to the PostgreSQL database is being closed due to the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` setting during a long API call, the recommended parameter to adjust would be:\n\n- `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`\n\nThis parameter is currently set to 10 minutes, which is not sufficient to cover the duration of the database transaction that includes a lengthy API call. The API call takes 10 minutes, which exceeds the timeout setting, leading to the termination of the connection.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you could consider increasing the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to a value that comfortably exceeds the expected maximum duration of any API call or processing time within a transaction in your application. This would prevent the database from prematurely closing the connection due to perceived idleness.\n\nRecommended parameters to adjust:\n```json\n[\"idle_in_transaction_session_timeout\"]\n```"}
