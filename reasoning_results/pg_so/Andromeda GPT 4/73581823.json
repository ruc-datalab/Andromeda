{"res": "Based on the detailed analysis and the issues described with the query performance, particularly the underestimation of rows leading to inefficient use of nested loops, the following parameters are recommended to potentially improve the query execution:\n\n1. **enable_seqscan**: Disabling sequential scans might encourage the planner to use indexes more effectively, especially when it underestimates the number of rows for a particular execution path.\n\n2. **enable_nestloop**: Disabling nested loops could force the planner to consider other join methods such as hash joins or merge joins, which might be more efficient given the large discrepancy in row estimation.\n\n3. **enable_bitmapscan**: Ensuring that bitmap scans are enabled can be beneficial, especially for handling large datasets where bitmap scans can efficiently combine multiple index scans.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted to guide the query planner towards more optimal execution plans, particularly in scenarios where the default plan choices are not performing well due to misestimations of row counts or other factors.\n\nRecommended parameters: ['enable_seqscan', 'enable_nestloop', 'enable_bitmapscan']"}
