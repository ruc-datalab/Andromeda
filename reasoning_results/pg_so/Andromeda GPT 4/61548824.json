{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the issues and the context provided in the user's query, the relevant PostgreSQL parameters that could be recommended are:\n\n1. **`plpythonu`** - This parameter is implicit in the context as the user is using the `plpythonu` language for creating PostgreSQL functions that execute Python code. This is crucial for setting up the environment to allow Python execution within PostgreSQL functions.\n\n2. **`search_path`** - This parameter might be relevant if the issue with module recognition (e.g., `sqlalchemy`) arises from PostgreSQL not correctly identifying the location of Python modules or dependencies. Adjusting the `search_path` could potentially help in resolving issues related to schema visibility, although it's more directly related to database objects than Python modules.\n\n3. **`statement_timeout`** - This parameter could be considered if there are concerns about the execution time of the triggered Python scripts, ensuring that they do not exceed a reasonable execution time and impact database performance.\n\n4. **`work_mem`** - This parameter might be adjusted to allocate more memory for complex operations that might be performed by the Python scripts triggered from PostgreSQL, especially if they involve significant data processing.\n\n5. **`log_min_error_statement`** - This parameter could be useful to adjust in order to capture more detailed logs in case of errors when the Python scripts are executed. This can help in debugging issues like the one mentioned where modules are not recognized.\n\nGiven the specific issues mentioned (especially the ImportError for `sqlalchemy`), it's also recommended to ensure that the Python environment used by PostgreSQL (through `plpythonu`) has access to all necessary Python packages. This might involve setting up the correct Python environment or virtual environment that includes all dependencies like `sqlalchemy`.\n\nOutputting the list of recommended parameters based on the context:\n\n```json\n[\"plpythonu\", \"search_path\", \"statement_timeout\", \"work_mem\", \"log_min_error_statement\"]\n```"}
