{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the nature of the issues described, the most relevant parameters to consider adjusting or investigating further would be:\n\n1. **`listen_addresses`** - This parameter controls the network interfaces on which PostgreSQL listens for incoming connections. Given the logs indicating listening on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, it's important to ensure this is configured correctly, especially in a WSL environment where network interfaces can behave differently than in a typical Linux installation.\n\n2. **`port`** - Ensuring that the PostgreSQL server is listening on the correct port and that there are no conflicts or issues with port accessibility in the WSL environment is crucial.\n\n3. **`shared_buffers`** - This parameter determines the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. Adjusting it might help manage how PostgreSQL handles memory, which could be relevant given the errors related to process termination and memory issues.\n\n4. **`max_connections`** - Given the errors related to server processes and potential shared memory corruption, it might be useful to review the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed to ensure that the server isn't being overloaded.\n\n5. **`wal_level`** and **`fsync`** - These parameters control the write-ahead logging level and the use of synchronous disk writes, respectively. Given the errors related to flushing dirty data and potential data integrity issues, reviewing these settings could provide insights into the failures observed.\n\n6. **`effective_io_concurrency`** - This parameter helps optimize the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL expects to be able to execute, and adjusting it might help with the I/O errors seen in the logs.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issues and the environment (WSL), it's also recommended to ensure that the PostgreSQL version being used is fully compatible with WSL and to check for any known issues specific to running PostgreSQL within WSL.\n\nPlease output list as:\n```plaintext\n['listen_addresses', 'port', 'shared_buffers', 'max_connections', 'wal_level', 'fsync', 'effective_io_concurrency']\n```"}
