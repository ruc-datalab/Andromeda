{"res": "Based on the scenario described and the issues you're encountering with the GIN index not being used effectively, the relevant parameter to consider from the provided documentation and context is `gin_pending_list_limit`. This parameter can influence the performance of GIN indexes by controlling the size of the pending list, which might be relevant if the index is frequently updated or if bulk inserts are common.\n\nHowever, the core issue seems to be related to the data type mismatch and the use of the appropriate operator class for the GIN index. Since the problem revolves around the index usage and performance, adjusting the `gin_pending_list_limit` might help if the index is not being updated efficiently due to a large pending list.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter to consider adjusting is:\n- `gin_pending_list_limit`\n\nThis parameter could potentially improve the performance by ensuring that the GIN index's pending list is managed more effectively, possibly leading to better utilization of the index during queries.\n\nOutput list as requested:\n```plaintext\n['gin_pending_list_limit']\n```"}
