{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the context of the error encountered, the issue seems to be related to the integrity of the primary key index on the `quizzes` table. The error message indicates a duplicate key violation, which is peculiar since querying the table shows no such duplicate. This could be due to index corruption or inconsistencies within the index itself.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, the following parameters and actions are recommended to address the issue:\n\n1. **`maintenance_work_mem`** - Increase this parameter to provide more memory for maintenance operations, which can help in rebuilding indexes more efficiently.\n\n2. **`max_parallel_maintenance_workers`** - Increase this parameter to allow more workers for maintenance tasks such as creating and rebuilding indexes, which can speed up the process.\n\nTo resolve the issue, consider the following steps:\n\n- Reindex the table to rebuild the primary key index and resolve any potential corruption:\n  ```sql\n  REINDEX TABLE quizzes;\n  ```\n\n- After reindexing, attempt to add the column again:\n  ```sql\n  ALTER TABLE quizzes ADD COLUMN deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;\n  ```\n\n- If the problem persists, consider validating the integrity of the table and its indexes:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'quizzes';\n  ```\n\n- Check for any hidden issues or inconsistencies in the table data:\n  ```sql\n  VACUUM FULL VERBOSE quizzes;\n  ANALYZE quizzes;\n  ```\n\nThese steps should help in resolving the issue related to adding a column due to a supposed duplicate key error. If the problem continues, further investigation into the database logs and deeper analysis of the table's structure and index metadata might be necessary.\n\nRecommended parameters based on the context and potential solutions are: `['maintenance_work_mem', 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers']`."}
