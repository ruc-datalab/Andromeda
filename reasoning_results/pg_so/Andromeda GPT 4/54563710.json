{"res": "Based on the provided information and the issues described in the query, the following parameters are relevant to address the replication lag and issues with the standby server not catching up:\n\n1. **wal_level** - Ensuring that `wal_level` is set to a sufficient level (such as `replica` or `logical`) is crucial for replication. This setting impacts the amount of information written to the WAL, which is necessary for the standby server to properly replicate changes from the primary.\n\n2. **max_replication_slots** - This parameter determines the maximum number of replication slots that the server can support. It's important to ensure that there are enough replication slots available for the standby servers. If the number of slots is insufficient, it could prevent new replicas from receiving data.\n\n3. **wal_writer_delay** - This parameter controls how often the WAL writer flushes WAL data. Adjusting this might help in situations where the WAL data is not being written or flushed frequently enough, potentially causing delays in replication.\n\nGiven the scenario described, where the replication delay grows over time, adjusting these parameters might help in resolving or mitigating the issues:\n\n- **wal_level** should be set to at least `replica`.\n- **max_replication_slots** should be reviewed and increased if necessary to accommodate all standby servers.\n- **wal_writer_delay** could be adjusted to optimize the frequency of WAL flushes, potentially reducing the replication lag.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to consider adjusting are:\n\n```json\n[\"wal_level\", \"max_replication_slots\", \"wal_writer_delay\"]\n```"}
