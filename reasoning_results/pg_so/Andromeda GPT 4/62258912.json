{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the behavior observed with the BRIN index, the following PostgreSQL parameter might be relevant to influence the planner's decision to use the index even when a `LIMIT` clause is present:\n\n- `enable_seqscan`: This parameter can be set to `off` to discourage the planner from choosing a sequential scan over other types of scans like an index scan. However, this should be used cautiously as it can lead to suboptimal query plans in other scenarios.\n\nGiven the context and the specific issue with the BRIN index and the `LIMIT` clause, here is the recommended parameter:\n\n```json\n[\"enable_seqscan\"]\n```\n\nThis parameter should be tested in a controlled environment to ensure that it does not negatively impact other queries and overall database performance. Adjusting `enable_seqscan` can help in forcing PostgreSQL to consider using the index, but it's important to monitor the overall impact on the query performance across the system."}
