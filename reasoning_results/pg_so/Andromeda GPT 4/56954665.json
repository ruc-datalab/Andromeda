{"res": "Based on the provided information and the error logs indicating issues with shared memory segments, it seems that the problem might be related to the configuration and management of shared memory in PostgreSQL. The error messages suggest that the shared memory segments are either being deleted or are inaccessible, which could be due to several reasons including system configuration, PostgreSQL settings, or external processes affecting the `/dev/shm` directory.\n\nGiven the context and the details from the manuals, the following parameters are relevant to address the issue:\n\n1. `dynamic_shared_memory_type` - This parameter specifies the dynamic shared memory implementation that PostgreSQL should use. Since you are experiencing issues with shared memory segments, adjusting this parameter might help. If the default setting (likely `posix` on Ubuntu) is causing issues, you might consider experimenting with other supported types like `sysv` to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n2. `min_dynamic_shared_memory` - This parameter specifies the amount of memory that should be allocated at server startup for use by parallel queries. Setting this parameter to a non-zero value ensures that a minimum amount of shared memory is reserved for parallel query execution, which might help in preventing the shared memory from being exhausted or affected by other processes.\n\nGiven the scenario described, the recommended parameters to review and potentially adjust are:\n\n```plaintext\n['dynamic_shared_memory_type', 'min_dynamic_shared_memory']\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be tested in a controlled environment to monitor their impact on the stability and performance of your PostgreSQL server, especially in relation to the shared memory issues you are encountering."}
