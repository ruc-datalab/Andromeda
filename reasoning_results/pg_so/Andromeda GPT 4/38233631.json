{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where you are updating a large volume of rows individually in a PostgreSQL database, the following parameters from the previously mentioned ones could be relevant to optimize the performance of your update operations:\n\n1. **synchronous_commit** - This parameter can be adjusted to reduce the durability guarantees in exchange for increased performance. By setting `synchronous_commit` to `off`, you can speed up the transaction completion time because the changes do not need to be flushed to disk before the transaction is considered complete. This is particularly useful in scenarios where performance is more critical than exact point-in-time data durability.\n\n2. **fsync** - Adjusting `fsync` can also impact performance. Disabling `fsync` (setting it to `off`) allows PostgreSQL to not immediately flush all changes to disk, which can significantly speed up operations that involve a lot of disk writes, like massive updates. However, this comes at the risk of data loss in the event of a power failure or system crash.\n\nGiven the nature of your update operations and the need for performance, these parameters could help in reducing the time taken for the updates to complete. However, it's important to consider the trade-offs in terms of data safety and consistency when adjusting these settings.\n\nRecommended parameters: ['synchronous_commit', 'fsync']"}
