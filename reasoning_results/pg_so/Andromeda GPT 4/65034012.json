{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the context of the previous questions, the recommended parameters to optimize the performance of your PostgreSQL queries, especially considering the use of indexes and sorting mechanisms, are:\n\n- `work_mem`: This parameter determines the amount of memory used for sorting operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. Increasing this might help in operations where large sorts are occurring, such as when using the `ORDER BY` clause on a column that has a functional index (like `UPPER(title)`).\n\n- `enable_sort`: This parameter controls the use of explicit sort operations in query plans. Since sorting is a significant part of your query, ensuring that this is enabled (or adjusting its settings if it's being inappropriately bypassed) could be beneficial.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their direct impact on sorting and memory usage during query execution, which are central to the issues described in your scenario.\n\nOutput list: ['work_mem', 'enable_sort']"}
