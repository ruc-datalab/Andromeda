{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario and the performance issues described, it seems that increasing the `work_mem` parameter has not led to the expected improvement in query performance. In fact, the performance worsened with higher `work_mem` settings. This could be due to several factors, including but not limited to, increased overhead from managing larger memory buffers, or the configuration of other related database parameters that might be influencing the overall performance.\n\nGiven the scenario where the sort operation still resorts to using disk (external merge Disk: 430104kB remains unchanged), it's clear that the `work_mem` setting, even at 64MB, is insufficient to keep the sort operation entirely in memory given the data volume and query complexity.\n\nHowever, since increasing `work_mem` alone did not help and even worsened the situation, it might be beneficial to look into other parameters or strategies:\n\n1. **maintenance_work_mem**: This parameter controls the maximum amount of memory used for maintenance operations such as creating indexes or vacuuming. If these operations are part of routine tasks that might be affecting performance, adjusting this parameter could help.\n\n2. **shared_buffers**: This parameter determines how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data. If this is too low, increasing it might help reduce disk I/O by keeping more data in memory.\n\n3. **effective_cache_size**: This parameter gives the planner an estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system and within PostgreSQL itself, not counting the memory directly managed by PostgreSQL (like `work_mem`). Setting this to a realistic value can help the planner make better choices about when to use memory for caching.\n\n4. **work_mem**: Given the scenario, it might be worth experimenting with even higher values cautiously, but it's important to monitor the overall system performance as this could affect other concurrent operations.\n\n5. **Consider indexing strategies**: If the queries involve sorting or filtering on specific columns frequently, ensure those columns are indexed appropriately.\n\n6. **Query rewriting or optimization**: Sometimes, rewriting the query or structuring it differently can yield performance benefits. For example, using EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries, or restructuring joins.\n\n7. **Hardware considerations**: If the configuration changes do not yield the desired results, it might also be a limitation of the current hardware, particularly disk I/O capabilities or overall system memory.\n\nGiven the information and the focus on PostgreSQL configuration parameters, the recommended parameters to revisit or adjust would be:\n\n```json\n['work_mem', 'maintenance_work_mem', 'shared_buffers', 'effective_cache_size']\n```"}
