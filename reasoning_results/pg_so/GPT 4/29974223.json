{"res": "Based on the description of the issue you're facing with PHP sessions in Symfony when using PostgreSQL, it seems like the problem might be related to how PostgreSQL handles session data compared to MySQL. Here are some database parameters and configurations you might consider adjusting to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Use Transactions**: Ensure that your session writes are wrapped in transactions. This can help in making sure that session writes are completed fully before they are considered done.\n\n2. **Locking Mechanism**: PostgreSQL and MySQL handle locking differently. You might need to explicitly handle row-level locking in your session management queries to prevent concurrent accesses from interfering with each other.\n\n3. **Session Serialization**: Check the serialization method used for storing session data. PostgreSQL might require a different serialization approach or more explicit handling compared to MySQL.\n\n4. **Connection Persistence**: Ensure that the database connection is persistent across requests. Non-persistent connections might be causing the session data to be lost.\n\n5. **Session Save Path**: Although this is typically used for file-based sessions, ensuring that the session save path is correctly configured and writable in your `php.ini` can sometimes affect database-based sessions as well.\n\n6. **Session Garbage Collection**: Configure the session garbage collection parameters in PostgreSQL to ensure that sessions are not being prematurely garbage-collected.\n\n7. **Error Handling and Logging**: Enable detailed error logging for your database interactions. This can help identify if there are silent failures or errors when writing or reading session data.\n\n8. **Database User Permissions**: Ensure that the database user has appropriate permissions to read from and write to the session table.\n\n9. **Optimize Session Table**: Use appropriate indexing on the session table, particularly on the session ID column, to improve read and write performance.\n\n10. **Network Latency and Timeout**: Check if network issues or database timeouts are affecting session data persistence.\n\n11. **Session Handler Configuration**: Review the configuration of `PdoSessionHandler` in Symfony to ensure all parameters are correctly set, particularly those related to database connection and session data handling.\n\n12. **PHP Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the PHP version you are using is compatible with the PostgreSQL driver and Symfony version, as incompatibilities might lead to session handling issues.\n\nThese recommendations are aimed at troubleshooting and potentially resolving the issue with session data not persisting across page reloads when using PostgreSQL for session management in Symfony. Adjusting these parameters and configurations might require careful testing to identify their impact on the issue."}
