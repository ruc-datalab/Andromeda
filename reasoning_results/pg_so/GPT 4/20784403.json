{"res": "It appears that there is a misunderstanding in the usage of the `pg_dump` command, specifically in how you are specifying the table name and the database name. The error message \"No matching tables were found\" suggests that `pg_dump` is unable to locate the table you specified in the database you intended. Here are the parameters you should adjust:\n\n1. **Database Name**: Ensure that the database name is correctly specified at the end of the command. It seems you intended to dump from the database named \"games\", but the placement might be incorrect or misinterpreted by the command parser.\n\n2. **Table Name Specification**: The table name should include the schema and the table name properly quoted to avoid confusion with the dot notation. \n\n3. **Output Redirection**: The syntax for redirecting output to a file should be correctly formatted.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your command:\n\n```bash\npg_dump -U postgres -t '\"2sample.sc\".\"error_log\"' --inserts -d games > dump.sql\n```\n\nExplanation of changes:\n- `-t '\"2sample.sc\".\"error_log\"'`: This ensures that the schema and table names are correctly interpreted. The entire identifier is enclosed in single quotes to treat the dot as a literal character within the double quotes.\n- `-d games`: Explicitly specifies the database name using the `-d` option to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nThus, the recommended parameters to adjust are:\n```json\n[\"-t '\\\"2sample.sc\\\".\\\"error_log\\\"'\", \"-d games\"]\n```"}
