{"res": "Based on the configuration details and the symptoms described (slow performance and unresponsiveness with multiple concurrent queries), here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your PostgreSQL configuration to potentially improve performance:\n\n1. **`shared_buffers`**: This parameter determines how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data. Given that your server has 4GB of RAM, the current setting of 1024MB might be too high, potentially leaving insufficient memory for other processes and for the operating system's cache. Consider reducing this to about 25% of your system's RAM, especially since PostgreSQL is not the only process running on the machine.\n\n2. **`work_mem`**: This setting controls the amount of memory used for internal sorting and other operations before writing to temporary disk files. The current setting of 100MB could be high per query if multiple queries are running simultaneously. Consider lowering this to reduce the risk of using excessive memory when multiple sessions are active.\n\n3. **`maintenance_work_mem`**: This parameter affects the maximum amount of memory used for maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. The current setting seems quite high relative to your total RAM. Reducing this might help in managing overall server load during heavy operations.\n\n4. **`max_connections`**: This is set to 100, which might be high for a server with limited resources. Consider reducing the number of max connections if each connected user is not always active. This reduction can help in managing the overall load and preventing the database from becoming overwhelmed.\n\n5. **`effective_cache_size`**: This parameter gives the planner an estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system and within PostgreSQL itself, beyond the amount allocated to `shared_buffers`. Given your total RAM, you might want to adjust this setting to better reflect the memory available for caching.\n\n6. **`checkpoint_segments` and `checkpoint_completion_target`**: These parameters control the frequency and nature of checkpoints. Adjusting these can help balance the write load and minimize the performance spikes associated with checkpoints. You might want to increase `checkpoint_segments` to allow more writes to accumulate before a checkpoint is triggered, and adjust `checkpoint_completion_target` to spread checkpoint I/O more evenly over time.\n\n7. **`wal_buffers`**: If not set, consider setting this to improve the performance of transaction log writes. This setting can be particularly effective if your workload involves many small transactions.\n\n8. **`fsync`**: It's currently turned off, which is risky as it can lead to data corruption in the event of a crash. Only disable fsync if you can tolerate potential data loss. Otherwise, it's generally recommended to enable fsync.\n\n9. **`full_page_writes`**: This is turned off, which can be risky as it helps in crash recovery. Consider turning it on to improve the robustness of your data integrity.\n\n10. **`autovacuum` settings**: Ensure that autovacuum is appropriately configured to prevent table bloat and to maintain query performance. The current settings seem reasonable, but keep an eye on autovacuum logs to ensure it runs effectively without overwhelming the system resources.\n\nHere's the output in the requested format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"shared_buffers\",\n    \"work_mem\",\n    \"maintenance_work_mem\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"effective_cache_size\",\n    \"checkpoint_segments\",\n    \"checkpoint_completion_target\",\n    \"wal_buffers\",\n    \"fsync\",\n    \"full_page_writes\",\n    \"autovacuum settings\"\n]\n```"}
