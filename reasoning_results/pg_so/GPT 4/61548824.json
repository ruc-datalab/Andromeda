{"res": "Based on the description and issues you've encountered, here are some recommended PostgreSQL parameters and configurations that might help resolve the problems:\n\n1. **`plpythonu` Library Path**: Ensure that the Python environment used by PostgreSQL (PL/Python) has access to all necessary Python libraries, including `sqlalchemy`. You might need to adjust the Python path within the PostgreSQL environment or ensure that the correct Python virtual environment is activated.\n\n2. **`session_replication_role`**: This parameter can be set to control the firing of triggers. If set to `replica`, triggers that are marked as `ENABLE REPLICA` will fire, while those marked as `ENABLE ALWAYS` will not. This might not directly solve your issue but can be useful for debugging or controlling trigger behavior in replication setups.\n\n3. **`statement_timeout`**: This parameter can be used to set a timeout for the execution of the Python script called by the trigger. If your script execution is expected to take a long time, adjusting this parameter might prevent timeouts.\n\n4. **`work_mem`**: Increase this parameter if your Python script and the queries it executes require more memory, especially when handling large datasets.\n\n5. **`log_min_error_statement`**: Set this parameter to `ERROR` or lower to log statements that cause errors. This can help in debugging issues like the one you're experiencing with module imports.\n\n6. **`log_error_verbosity`**: Increase the verbosity of error logs to get more detailed information about errors, such as import errors in Python scripts.\n\n7. **`shared_preload_libraries`**: Ensure that `plpythonu` is listed in this parameter to preload the PL/Python library at server start, which can sometimes help with performance and stability.\n\n8. **`max_stack_depth`**: Increase this parameter if your Python script is complex and requires a deeper stack, especially when using recursion or importing multiple modules.\n\n9. **`client_encoding`**: Ensure this is set to a compatible encoding like `UTF8` to avoid issues with character encoding in scripts and data.\n\n10. **`search_path`**: Configure this parameter to include the schemas where your functions and tables are located, ensuring that all database objects are correctly resolved without needing explicit schema references in your scripts.\n\nThese parameters and settings can be adjusted in your PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`) or set at the session level using the `SET` command within a SQL script or function. Adjusting these parameters might help resolve issues related to performance, memory usage, logging, and module loading in PL/Python functions."}
