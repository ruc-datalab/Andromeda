{"res": "To address the issue of escaping single quotes for compatibility with PostgreSQL when using `mysqldump`, you can use the `--hex-blob` option. This option ensures that binary columns (such as BLOB, BINARY, VARBINARY) are dumped using hexadecimal notation, which can help avoid issues with special characters in the data. However, for escaping single quotes specifically, you might need to manually replace single quotes in the dump file or use a different method to handle the escaping, as `mysqldump` does not provide a direct parameter to change the escaping of single quotes to double quotes (`''`).\n\nHere are the recommended parameters to use with `mysqldump` for better compatibility with PostgreSQL:\n\n```json\n[\"--complete-insert\", \"--no-create-info\", \"--no-create-db\", \"--compatible=postgresql\", \"--hex-blob\"]\n```\n\nAfter using these parameters, you may still need to post-process the SQL dump file to replace single quotes with double quotes for string literals. This can be done using a simple `sed` command in Unix/Linux environments:\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"s/\\\\\\'/''/g\" music_files.sql\n```\n\nThis command replaces all instances of `\\'` (escaped single quote) with `''` (two single quotes), which is the correct escaping for string literals in PostgreSQL."}
