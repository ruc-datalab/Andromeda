{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the PostgreSQL server is experiencing slow performance and unresponsiveness when executing multiple queries simultaneously, the following parameters could be adjusted to potentially improve performance:\n\n1. **max_connections**: This parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database. Given that there are a few hundred users simultaneously connected, it might be necessary to adjust this parameter to ensure that the server can handle the load. However, increasing this value can also increase the demand on system resources.\n\n2. **work_mem**: This parameter specifies the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. Increasing this value can help speed up queries that involve sorts, joins, or aggregates.\n\n3. **maintenance_work_mem**: Increasing this parameter can improve the efficiency of maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY.\n\n4. **shared_buffers**: This parameter determines the amount of memory the database server will use for caching data. Increasing this value can improve database performance by reducing disk I/O.\n\n5. **effective_cache_size**: This parameter helps the planner to make better choices of plans by estimating the effective size of the cache (including filesystem cache).\n\n6. **checkpoint_segments** and **checkpoint_completion_target**: These parameters control the frequency and timing of disk writes for transaction logs. Adjusting these can help balance between performance and reliability.\n\n7. **autovacuum**: Ensuring that autovacuum is enabled and properly configured can help prevent table bloat and preserve the performance of the database.\n\n8. **wal_buffers**: If the database writes are frequently waiting on WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) availability, increasing this parameter can help.\n\n9. **fsync**: Turning fsync off can improve performance but at the risk of data integrity during a crash. It's generally not recommended unless in a highly controlled environment.\n\n10. **full_page_writes**: Disabling this can improve performance but might increase the risk of data corruption in certain failure scenarios.\n\n11. **log_min_duration_statement**: Setting this parameter to log long queries can help identify slow queries that might be impacting the performance.\n\n12. **effective_io_concurrency**: Adjusting this parameter can help optimize the use of available I/O channels when the database is performing read operations.\n\nGiven the server's specifications and the issues described, here is a list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"work_mem\",\n    \"maintenance_work_mem\",\n    \"shared_buffers\",\n    \"effective_cache_size\",\n    \"checkpoint_segments\",\n    \"checkpoint_completion_target\",\n    \"autovacuum\",\n    \"wal_buffers\",\n    \"fsync\",\n    \"full_page_writes\",\n    \"log_min_duration_statement\",\n    \"effective_io_concurrency\"\n]\n```"}
