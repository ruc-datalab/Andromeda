{"res": "To address your requirement of blocking all connections to a specific database and closing all existing connections during schema modifications, and then allowing new connections back, you can use the following PostgreSQL parameters and SQL commands:\n\n1. **Disconnecting all existing connections**:\n   You can use the `pg_terminate_backend()` function to terminate all connections to a specific database. This function requires the process ID of each session connected to the database.\n\n2. **Blocking all new connections**:\n   You can set the `datallowconn` property of the database to `false` to prevent new connections. This can be done using the `ALTER DATABASE` command.\n\n3. **Allowing new connections back**:\n   Set the `datallowconn` property of the database back to `true` using the `ALTER DATABASE` command to allow new connections.\n\nHere are the SQL commands to perform these actions:\n\n- **To disconnect all existing connections to a specific database**:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)\n  FROM pg_stat_activity\n  WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'target_database_name'\n    AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();\n  ```\n\n- **To block all new connections to a specific database**:\n  ```sql\n  ALTER DATABASE target_database_name ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = false;\n  ```\n\n- **To allow new connections to a specific database**:\n  ```sql\n  ALTER DATABASE target_database_name ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = true;\n  ```\n\nReplace `target_database_name` with the name of the database you are modifying.\n\nGiven the context of your question, the relevant parameters and SQL commands are not directly listed in the initial set of database parameters you provided. However, the actions you need are performed through SQL commands rather than setting specific parameters in a configuration file or server command line.\n\nTherefore, the output list based on your specific request would be:\n```json\n[]\n```\nThis indicates that there are no direct \"parameters\" to set for this operation, but rather SQL commands to execute."}
