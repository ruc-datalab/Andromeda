{"res": "Based on your scenario where a table is heavily inserted into and auto-vacuum settings have been adjusted to run more frequently, here are some additional parameters you might consider tuning to further enhance performance in your PostgreSQL setup on GCP CloudSQL:\n\n1. **`maintenance_work_mem`**: Increasing this parameter allows more memory to be used during maintenance operations like vacuuming, which can speed up the process.\n\n2. **`autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`**: This parameter determines the fraction of the table size that will be added to `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` to decide when to trigger an autovacuum. Reducing this might lead to more frequent vacuuming, preventing transaction ID wraparound issues and keeping table bloat under control.\n\n3. **`autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`**: This sets the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger an autovacuum. Adjusting this can help in starting autovacuum processes sooner, especially in high-insert environments.\n\n4. **`autovacuum_naptime`**: Reducing the naptime can increase the frequency of autovacuum checks, which might be beneficial in a rapidly changing database.\n\n5. **`work_mem`**: This parameter controls the amount of memory used for sorting and other operations. While not directly related to vacuuming, increasing it can improve the performance of queries that run concurrently with autovacuum.\n\n6. **`autovacuum_max_workers`**: Increasing the number of workers can allow more autovacuum processes to run concurrently, which can be beneficial in a large database with many tables.\n\n7. **`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`**: This parameter can be reduced to allow autovacuum to complete faster, though it might increase the load on your system. It's a trade-off between vacuum speed and the impact on other operations.\n\n8. **`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`**: Increasing this limit can allow autovacuum processes to consume more resources, potentially speeding up the vacuum process but at the cost of higher load during the operation.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"maintenance_work_mem\",\n    \"autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor\",\n    \"autovacuum_vacuum_threshold\",\n    \"autovacuum_naptime\",\n    \"work_mem\",\n    \"autovacuum_max_workers\",\n    \"autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay\",\n    \"autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit\"\n]\n```"}
