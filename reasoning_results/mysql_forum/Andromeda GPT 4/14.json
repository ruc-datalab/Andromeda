{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the parameters mentioned in the reference questions and manuals, the relevant parameters for your situation where you need to adjust settings for a non-root MySQL installation include:\n\n- `socket`: This parameter specifies the location of the socket file used for local client connections to the server. Since you need to run MySQL in your home directory, you should specify a socket file within your accessible directory.\n- `port`: This parameter defines the TCP/IP port on which the server listens for connections. Changing this is necessary if the default port is already in use or if you have restrictions on which ports you can use.\n- `basedir`: This parameter sets the base directory of the MySQL installation.\n- `datadir`: This parameter sets the directory for the database data files.\n\nThese parameters are crucial for setting up MySQL to operate under a specific user account with custom directory paths and access configurations.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['socket', 'port', 'basedir', 'datadir']\n```"}
