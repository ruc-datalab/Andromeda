{"res": "To ensure a safe shutdown or restart of MySQL where active tables, such as your forum's posts table, do not get corrupted, you can use the following recommended parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_fast_shutdown**: This parameter controls the InnoDB shutdown process. Setting it to 1 ensures a safe but fast shutdown by flushing the logs to disk and making the necessary preparations to ensure data consistency. This is safer than setting it to 2, which skips some of these steps for the fastest shutdown but increases the risk of data corruption.\n\n2. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter is crucial for ensuring data integrity. Setting it to 1 ensures that the log buffer is written to the log file and the log file is flushed to disk at each transaction commit, which provides ACID compliance.\n\n3. **sync_binlog**: This parameter ensures that the binary log is flushed to disk at every commit when set to 1. This is important for data recovery and consistency, especially if you are using replication.\n\nUsing these parameters helps minimize the risk of table corruption during MySQL shutdowns or restarts by ensuring that data changes are properly flushed to disk.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['innodb_fast_shutdown', 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit', 'sync_binlog']\n```"}
