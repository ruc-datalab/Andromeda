{"res": "Based on the issues described in your query and the parameters discussed in the reference questions and manuals, the recommended parameters to consider adjusting or investigating are:\n\n1. `local_infile` - This parameter should be enabled if you are using LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statements to upload data. It allows the server to read files located on the client host.\n\n2. `sql_mode` - Adjusting SQL mode can help manage how MySQL handles certain types of data and queries, which might be relevant if there are issues with strict mode affecting data loading.\n\n3. `max_allowed_packet` - This parameter is crucial when dealing with large data files or batches of queries. Increasing its size can prevent issues like \"MySQL server has gone away\" when the data or query is too large for the default packet size.\n\nGiven the description of your issue where no data is loaded and no errors are reported, you might want to ensure that `local_infile` is enabled if your script uses LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE. Additionally, checking the `sql_mode` to ensure it's not overly restrictive could be helpful. Lastly, although not directly mentioned in your query, `max_allowed_packet` could be a factor if the data file is large or contains large rows.\n\nThus, the recommended parameters are:\n\n```json\n['local_infile', 'sql_mode', 'max_allowed_packet']\n```"}
