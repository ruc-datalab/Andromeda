{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where you are encountering issues with opening tablespace files in a parallel MySQL setup, the relevant parameters to consider would be those that can help manage and troubleshoot issues related to InnoDB tablespaces and recovery. The error message suggests issues with tablespace files that might not have been handled properly (e.g., moving or deleting files without the proper MySQL commands).\n\nFrom the provided documentation and the context of your issue, the following parameters are recommended:\n\n1. `innodb_force_recovery` - This parameter can be used to start the server in recovery mode, which can help bypass certain errors during startup. This might allow you to at least start the server and perform some operations, such as dumping the database.\n\n2. `innodb_file_per_table` - Ensuring this is enabled can help manage individual tablespace files better, which might simplify recovery operations and reduce the risk of corruption by isolating issues to specific tables.\n\nHere is the output list of recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n['innodb_force_recovery', 'innodb_file_per_table']\n```"}
