{"res": "Based on the detailed error log and the symptoms described, it appears that the MySQL server is experiencing issues related to InnoDB corruption and crash recovery. The error messages suggest problems with the InnoDB engine's ability to process transactions and manage the buffer pool effectively. Here are the recommended parameters to address these issues:\n\n1. **innodb_force_recovery**: This parameter can be set to different levels to force the InnoDB storage engine to start up while preventing background operations that could lead to further corruption. Given the severity of the errors, starting with a moderate level of recovery (e.g., 3 or 4) might allow the server to start without further corruption and enable data dumping or other recovery actions.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing the buffer pool size can help improve the performance and stability of the database by reducing disk I/O for InnoDB tables. Given the errors related to buffer pool initialization and operations, ensuring this is adequately sized relative to the dataset is crucial.\n\n3. **innodb_log_file_size**: This parameter determines the size of the log files in the log group of InnoDB. A larger log file size can provide more room for InnoDB to write concurrent transactions before having to flush the log to disk, which can be beneficial during heavy transaction loads or recovery operations.\n\n4. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing the log buffer size allows more transactions to be held in memory before being written to the log file on disk, which can reduce disk I/O and potentially decrease the chance of errors during crash recovery.\n\n5. **max_allowed_packet**: This parameter might need adjustment if there are issues with large packets causing disconnects or errors during operations like backups or complex queries.\n\n6. **innodb_purge_threads**: If the server version supports this parameter, increasing the number of purge threads can help in faster cleanup of undo logs which seems to be one of the issues from the logs provided.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters based on the analysis:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_force_recovery', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'innodb_log_file_size', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'max_allowed_packet', 'innodb_purge_threads']\n```"}
