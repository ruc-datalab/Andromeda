{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the characteristics of the MySQL database, the following parameters are recommended to potentially improve the performance of your query:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. Increasing this size can significantly improve read operations and reduce disk I/O by keeping more data in memory, especially for a large table like yours with 10 million rows.\n\n2. **thread_cache_size** - This parameter determines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many threads already there. Reusing threads can be faster than creating new ones.\n\n3. **read_buffer_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer that is allocated for sequential table scans. Increasing it might improve the performance of full table scans, which seems relevant to your count query.\n\n4. **read_rnd_buffer_size** - This parameter is used for reading rows in sorted order following a key-sorting operation. Although your query might not directly benefit from this, complex queries involving sorting might see improvements.\n\n5. **sort_buffer_size** - This parameter is the memory buffer size to use for sorting. This can be useful if your queries involve sorting operations, although your specific query provided does not.\n\n6. **max_connections** - This parameter defines the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. Increasing this value can allow more concurrent users but be aware that it might increase memory usage.\n\n7. **myisam_sort_buffer_size** - If any temporary tables are being used or implicit conversions between storage engines, having a larger sort buffer might help, although your table is InnoDB.\n\n8. **max_allowed_packet** - This parameter sets the maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string. The setting is useful for complex queries or large BLOB type data handling, but less so for your specific query.\n\nGiven the nature of your query and the table structure, the most impactful parameters are likely to be `innodb_buffer_pool_size` and `read_buffer_size`. Adjusting these should be done cautiously, monitoring the system's performance and stability after changes."}
