{"res": "Based on the detailed information provided and the issues you are facing with the query performance, particularly with the \"Copying to tmp table\" state, the following parameters are recommended to be adjusted:\n\n1. **tmp_table_size**: Increase this parameter to allow more space for temporary tables to be stored in memory rather than on disk. Since you have sufficient RAM (16GB) and the current setting of 64M seems to be insufficient for the complexity and size of your queries, increasing this size will help in reducing the I/O overhead associated with disk-based temporary tables.\n\n2. **max_heap_table_size**: This parameter should be increased in conjunction with `tmp_table_size` to ensure that temporary tables in memory do not exceed this limit and are forced onto disk. Aligning this value with `tmp_table_size` provides a consistent limit for in-memory temporary tables.\n\nGiven the complexity of your queries and the volume of data being processed, ensuring that these parameters are adequately sized will help mitigate the performance bottlenecks you are experiencing. Additionally, since you have already adjusted these to 64M and are still facing issues, a significant increase might be necessary, depending on the typical size of the data sets involved in your queries.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your scenario:\n```json\n['tmp_table_size', 'max_heap_table_size']\n```"}
