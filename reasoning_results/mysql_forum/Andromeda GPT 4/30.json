{"res": "For the issue described in your query about importing a CSV file with inconsistent quotation around fields, the primary concern is handling the parsing of fields correctly given the presence of commas within some data fields. The `mysqlimport` utility and the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command in MySQL provide options to specify how to handle enclosed and terminated characters, but they generally expect consistency in the format.\n\nGiven the nature of your problem, where only certain fields are enclosed in quotes, and considering the parameters from the reference questions, the most relevant MySQL parameters to adjust or consider would be:\n\n1. `local_infile`: This parameter needs to be enabled to allow the import of local files using `LOAD DATA INFILE` or `mysqlimport`.\n2. `sql_mode`: Adjusting SQL mode can help with handling different formatting and import scenarios, although it might not directly resolve the issue of mixed enclosure in CSV fields.\n\nHowever, to address your specific issue of mixed quotation marks, you might need to preprocess the CSV file to ensure consistent formatting (either all fields enclosed by quotes or none). MySQL's import utilities do not natively support mixed enclosure handling directly through parameters. If preprocessing the file is not an option, you might need to consider a custom script to parse and properly format the CSV before importing it into MySQL.\n\nThus, the recommended parameters based on your scenario and the reference questions are:\n```json\n['local_infile', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
