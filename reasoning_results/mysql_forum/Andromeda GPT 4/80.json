{"res": "For setting up data replication in MySQL where updates are received from the master to the replicated server, and you have the ability to periodically purge data from the replicated server, you can consider the following parameters:\n\n1. **`sql_log_bin`** - This parameter can be used to control the binary logging on a per-session basis. You can temporarily disable binary logging (set `sql_log_bin=0`) when performing purge operations on the replicated server to ensure that these operations do not get replicated back to the master or affect other replicas.\n\n2. **`binlog_format`** - Ensuring that the binary log format is set appropriately (usually ROW or MIXED) is crucial for replication accuracy and performance. This setting affects how changes are logged and replicated.\n\n3. **`init_file`** - This parameter can be used to specify a file that contains SQL statements to be executed when the server starts. You can use this to set up initial states or perform cleanup tasks on the replicated server upon startup.\n\nThese parameters will help in setting up and managing the replication process according to your specified needs, allowing updates to be replicated from the master while also enabling periodic purging of data on the replicated server for optimized report query performance."}
