{"res": "Based on the error message \"Error code 2006. MySQL server has gone away\" and the nature of your issue with large records in the dump file, the most relevant parameters to adjust would be those that handle packet size and possibly buffer sizes to accommodate the large data sizes during the restore process. From the previously mentioned parameters and the context of your problem, the recommended parameters are:\n\n- `max_allowed_packet`\n\nThis parameter should be increased to accommodate the large size of individual records in your dump file, especially since one record is as large as 5MB. The default value might be too small to handle such large records, leading to the server disconnecting or \"going away\" during the process.\n\nTherefore, the output list of recommended parameters is:\n\n```json\n['max_allowed_packet']\n```"}
