{"res": "Based on the scenario you've described, it seems that you are concerned about the security of connections to your MySQL server, particularly when connecting via IP address without explicitly specifying SSL certificates. To enforce SSL connections for all client connections, you can use the `require_secure_transport` parameter. This parameter ensures that all connections to the MySQL server use secure transport (i.e., SSL/TLS). Here's the recommended parameter to enforce secure connections:\n\n```plaintext\n['require_secure_transport']\n```\n\nThis parameter will help ensure that all connections, regardless of how they are made (whether via localhost, 127.0.0.1, or an external IP address), are required to use SSL, thereby addressing your concern about connections being made without SSL certificates when using the server's IP address."}
