{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of your query about creating a new user account 'testapi' for applications to read/write data from the 'survey' database in a master-slave MySQL setup, the relevant parameters to consider would be:\n\n1. **sql_log_bin** - This parameter is crucial in a replication setup. It controls the binary logging on a per-session basis. When creating a new user or making changes that should not be replicated to the slave, you might toggle this setting. However, in your case, since you want the user to have read/write access and presumably want these changes to be replicated to the slave, this parameter should be enabled (which is the default).\n\n2. **read_only** - This parameter is important if you are considering where to create the user. In a master-slave configuration, the master should typically have `read_only` set to `OFF` (allowing writes), and the slave should have `read_only` set to `ON` (preventing writes). Since you want the 'testapi' user to have write access to the 'survey' database, you should create this user on the master. The slave, being read-only, will replicate this user but won't allow write operations by default.\n\nGiven your scenario, where you need to create a user that can read and write to a specific database in a master-slave environment, the recommended parameters are:\n\n- **sql_log_bin**\n- **read_only**\n\nThese parameters will help ensure that your user creation and permissions are correctly handled in the context of your MySQL replication setup.\n\nOutput list: ['sql_log_bin', 'read_only']"}
