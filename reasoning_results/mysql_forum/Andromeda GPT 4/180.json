{"res": "Based on the information provided and the nature of the query, the relevant parameters to consider for modifying the behavior of the `MATCH(...) AGAINST(...)` clause in relation to ignoring specific characters like the underscore ('_') are:\n\n- `ft_stopword_file`: This parameter is used to specify a file that contains a list of stopwords for MyISAM full-text search indexes. Although it primarily deals with stopwords, understanding and manipulating the environment of full-text searches might provide insights or indirect solutions.\n\n- `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`: This parameter enables or disables the use of the built-in stopword list for InnoDB full-text search indexes. While it directly affects stopwords, adjusting full-text search settings might indirectly influence how characters are interpreted or indexed.\n\n- `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`: This parameter specifies a server-wide stopword table for InnoDB full-text search indexes. Like the previous parameters, while focused on stopwords, adjustments here might indirectly affect character handling in full-text searches.\n\n- `ngram_token_size`: This parameter defines the size of the ngram tokens used in full-text searches. Although it's more related to the granularity of tokenization rather than character ignoring, understanding tokenization behavior could potentially be leveraged to influence how underscores are treated.\n\nThese parameters are suggested because they relate to the configuration of full-text search indexes, which is the context of the user's problem. However, it's important to note that none of these parameters directly address the issue of ignoring specific characters like underscores in `MATCH(...) AGAINST(...)` clauses. Further investigation into MySQL's full-text search capabilities or alternative querying strategies might be necessary if these parameters do not yield the desired outcome.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['ft_stopword_file', 'innodb_ft_enable_stopword', 'innodb_ft_server_stopword_table', 'ngram_token_size']\n```"}
