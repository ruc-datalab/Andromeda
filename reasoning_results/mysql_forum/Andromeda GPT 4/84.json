{"res": "Based on the description of your issue, where the PHP application cannot connect to MySQL after a restart until a manual login is performed via MySQL Workbench, it seems like there might be an issue related to the initialization of MySQL and how it handles connections post-restart. The error message 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)' typically indicates a problem with user authentication or privileges.\n\nGiven the parameters listed in the reference questions and manuals, the following parameters might be relevant to investigate and adjust in your MySQL configuration to potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1. `init_connect` - This parameter specifies a command that is executed for each client that connects and successfully authenticates. If there is a command or script specified here that fails upon initial connection after a restart, it could prevent subsequent connections until a successful manual login is performed.\n\n2. `default_authentication_plugin` - Since the authentication method can affect how users are recognized and authenticated, ensuring that this is set correctly according to the needs of your PHP application and MySQL Workbench might help.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to check and potentially adjust in your scenario are:\n\n```plaintext\n['init_connect', 'default_authentication_plugin']\n```"}
