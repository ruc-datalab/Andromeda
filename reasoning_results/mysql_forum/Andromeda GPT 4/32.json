{"res": "Based on the provided configuration and the server specifications (IIS6 / Single-3.07GHz chip / 1GB RAM), the MySQL settings need careful adjustment to ensure that the server does not get overwhelmed, especially given the high CPU usage reported. Here are some recommended parameters to tweak:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is set to 384M, which might be too high considering the server only has 1GB of RAM. Reducing this value can help free up RAM for other processes and reduce swapping, which can be a source of high CPU usage. A recommended value might be around 128M or less, depending on other applications' needs.\n\n2. **thread_cache_size**: This is currently set to 8. Given the CPU constraints and the nature of the workload (mostly static sites with two heavier applications), this value seems reasonable. However, monitoring the Threads_created status variable can help adjust this value more precisely.\n\n3. **key_buffer_size**: Set at 2M, which is generally low, but since the server is using InnoDB as the default storage engine, increasing this might not have a significant impact. However, if MyISAM tables are also in use, consider increasing this slightly if RAM allows.\n\n4. **query_cache_size**: Currently at 32M, which can be a considerable amount given the total RAM. Reducing this to around 16M or even less could help, especially since the query cache can sometimes degrade performance due to overhead in invalidations.\n\n5. **max_connections**: Set to 300, which might be too high for such a server, potentially leading to excessive memory use when all connections are utilized. Consider lowering this to around 100 or fewer.\n\n6. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This is set to 8M. Depending on the write load, this might be adjusted, but given the server's limited resources, this setting is likely adequate.\n\n7. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: Set to 8, which is a reasonable starting point. Monitor the server's performance and adjust as necessary, possibly lowering it if CPU usage remains high.\n\n8. **tmp_table_size**: Set to 7M. Ensure that this setting aligns with max_heap_table_size to prevent issues with temporary tables becoming too large and causing disk writes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the recommended parameters to adjust would be:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'thread_cache_size', 'key_buffer_size', 'query_cache_size', 'max_connections', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'innodb_thread_concurrency', 'tmp_table_size']\n```"}
