{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the information from the manuals, it seems that the main issue you are facing is related to the character set and collation settings that control how text data is encoded, stored, and retrieved in your MySQL environment. Since your data is in cp1251 encoding and you are experiencing issues with character display after transferring to a new host, the following parameters are relevant to address your problem:\n\n1. **`character_set_client`**: This parameter should be set to `cp1251` to ensure that the client (your application or interface) sends queries encoded in cp1251.\n\n2. **`character_set_connection`**: This parameter should be set to `cp1251` to ensure that the text data sent by the client is interpreted by the MySQL server using cp1251 encoding during the connection.\n\n3. **`character_set_results`**: This parameter should be set to `cp1251` to ensure that the MySQL server returns query results encoded in cp1251.\n\n4. **`collation_connection`**: This parameter should be set to `cp1251_general_ci` to specify the collation for the connection, which affects sorting and comparison operations.\n\nThese settings can be adjusted in your MySQL configuration or set dynamically using the `SET` command in your SQL session. Here is how you might configure these settings dynamically:\n\n```sql\nSET character_set_client = 'cp1251';\nSET character_set_connection = 'cp1251';\nSET character_set_results = 'cp1251';\nSET collation_connection = 'cp1251_general_ci';\n```\n\nBy configuring these parameters, you should be able to ensure that the data transfer between your old host and new host maintains the correct encoding, and that data is displayed correctly in both phpMyAdmin and your web application.\n\nRecommended parameters list: `['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_results', 'collation_connection']`."}
