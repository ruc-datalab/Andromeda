{"res": "Based on the issues described in your query, it seems that the strictness of data type checks and SQL mode settings in MySQL are causing the exceptions you're encountering. To address these issues, you can adjust the following MySQL server parameters:\n\n1. **sql_mode** - This parameter controls the SQL mode of the server. It can be set to different values that affect the behavior of MySQL, including how strictly it adheres to SQL standards and how it handles invalid or missing data in queries. By adjusting this parameter, you can make MySQL less strict. For example, you might want to remove modes like `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` or `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` if they are enabled.\n\n2. **innodb_strict_mode** - This parameter controls whether InnoDB operates in strict mode. In strict mode, certain conditions produce errors instead of warnings. If this is causing issues with your queries, you might consider disabling it.\n\nHere is the recommended list of parameters to adjust based on your description:\n\n```json\n[\"sql_mode\", \"innodb_stric_mode\"]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should help in making MySQL less picky about the data types and format issues you are encountering. Make sure to test changes in a development environment before applying them in production to understand their impact."}
