{"res": "Based on the information provided and the context of the issue described in your query, where a full-text search for \"java\" returns an empty set, the likely parameters that could influence this behavior are related to the configuration of the full-text search itself. Here are the recommended parameters to consider adjusting:\n\n1. **`innodb_ft_min_token_size`** - This parameter defines the minimum length of the token in characters for InnoDB tables that are considered for full-text indexing. If \"java\" is shorter than the current setting, it might not be indexed.\n\n2. **`ft_min_word_len`** - Similar to `innodb_ft_min_token_size`, but applicable for MyISAM tables. It defines the minimum length of words that are included in a MyISAM full-text index.\n\n3. **`innodb_ft_max_token_size`** - This parameter sets the maximum length of the token that InnoDB tables consider for full-text indexing. Ensuring this is appropriately configured can help in including relevant tokens.\n\n4. **`ft_max_word_len`** - This is the MyISAM equivalent for setting the maximum token size in full-text indexing.\n\nAdjusting these parameters can help ensure that shorter words like \"java\" are not excluded from the index due to their length, thereby improving the effectiveness of your full-text search queries.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['innodb_ft_min_token_size', 'ft_min_word_len', 'innodb_ft_max_token_size', 'ft_max_word_len']\n```"}
