{"res": "Based on the query requirement to select rows with duplicated 'Horizon_SKU', the recommended parameter from the provided list that could be relevant is:\n\n- ['group_concat_max_len']\n\nThis parameter is useful when dealing with string aggregation functions in MySQL, which might be used in complex queries involving grouping and concatenating results. However, for the specific task of selecting duplicated rows based on 'Horizon_SKU', no special MySQL system parameter settings are typically required. The query itself would be more focused on SQL logic rather than database configuration parameters.\n\nIf you were to optimize the query or handle large datasets, parameters like 'innodb_buffer_pool_size' or 'tmp_table_size' might be considered, but these are not listed in your provided options. Therefore, the most relevant from your list is:\n\n- ['group_concat_max_len']\n\nThis is included primarily because it's the only parameter that could potentially be related to handling results in grouped SQL queries, even though it's not directly applicable to the simple duplication check query described."}
