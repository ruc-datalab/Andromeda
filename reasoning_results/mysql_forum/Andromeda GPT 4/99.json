{"res": "Based on the detailed scenario you've described and the issues you're encountering with sleeping connections that do not release locks, leading to locks on entire databases, and considering the information from the manuals provided, the following parameters are recommended to be reviewed and potentially adjusted:\n\n1. **`autocommit`** - Since you mentioned issues with sleeping connections holding locks, ensuring that `autocommit` is properly set can help manage how transactions are committed and thus how locks are released.\n\n2. **`innodb_table_locks`** - This parameter should be checked to ensure that InnoDB is aware of table locks, which can help in managing deadlocks and lock contention more effectively.\n\n3. **`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`** - Adjusting this parameter might help in resolving issues where transactions are waiting excessively long for locks, which could be contributing to the issues you're seeing with locked tables.\n\n4. **`innodb_thread_concurrency`** - Given that you have a high-capacity system, ensuring that this parameter is set appropriately can help in managing how InnoDB handles thread concurrency, which might indirectly affect how locks are managed.\n\n5. **`innodb_thread_sleep_delay`** - Although it might be less directly related, reviewing this parameter in the context of `innodb_thread_concurrency` being set to a non-zero value could provide additional tuning opportunities for performance optimization.\n\nThese parameters are chosen based on their relevance to transaction and lock management in MySQL, particularly focusing on the behavior you've described with sleeping connections and lock handling in a master/master replication setup. Adjusting these settings should be done cautiously, with changes tested in a staging environment before being applied to production."}
