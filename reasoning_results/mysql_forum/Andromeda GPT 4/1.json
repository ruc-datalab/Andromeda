{"res": "Based on the provided scenario and the reference to the manual and previous user questions, the following parameters are recommended to optimize the MySQL configuration for improved performance during imports and general operations:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - Increasing this value allows more data to be held in memory, reducing disk I/O. Given the server has 64GB of RAM, setting this to a higher value, such as 48G (75% of RAM), could significantly improve performance, especially for InnoDB tables which are heavily used in your scenario.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size** - This parameter is crucial for improving the performance of MyISAM tables. Although your focus seems to be on InnoDB, ensuring this is adequately set (e.g., 256M) can help if any MyISAM tables are still in use.\n\n3. **table_open_cache** - Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of opening and closing tables frequently, which is beneficial during heavy importing tasks.\n\n4. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters control the maximum size of in-memory temporary tables. They should be increased if you are performing complex queries that involve a lot of sorting or temporary tables. Setting both to a larger value, like 256M, can help avoid creating on-disk temporary tables, which are slower.\n\n5. **innodb_log_file_size** - A larger log file size can reduce the need for frequent flushes to disk. Given the high volume of transactions during imports, increasing this value can improve performance.\n\n6. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit** - Setting this to 2 can improve performance by writing the log to the file system cache but not flushing it to disk on every commit. This setting is less safe in terms of data integrity but can be used if performance is the priority.\n\n7. **innodb_flush_method** - Setting this to O_DIRECT can help reduce I/O overhead by allowing InnoDB to directly write to the disk, bypassing the operating system's cache.\n\n8. **query_cache_size** - If queries are not highly dynamic, increasing the query cache can help reduce CPU usage by serving repeated queries directly from the cache.\n\nGiven these considerations, the recommended parameters to adjust in your `my.cnf` for the described MySQL server scenario are:\n\n```json\n[\"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"key_buffer_size\", \"table_open_cache\", \"tmp_table_size\", \"max_heap_table_size\", \"innodb_log_file_size\", \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\", \"innodb_flush_method\", \"query_cache_size\"]\n```"}
