{"res": "Based on the information provided and the issues described, it seems that the main concern is related to the settings of `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size`, and `innodb_buffer_pool_instances`. The MySQL server might not restart due to incorrect configuration of these parameters, especially if `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is not set to a multiple of `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances`.\n\nGiven the details in your INI file and the rules from the documentation, here are the recommended parameters to check and adjust:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, which is a storage area to hold data and indexes of your database. It must be a multiple of `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances`.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size** - This parameter defines the size of each chunk within the buffer pool. It can only be modified at startup and must be in 1MB increments.\n\n3. **innodb_buffer_pool_instances** - This parameter defines the number of instances of the buffer pool. This setting can help in managing the buffer pool more efficiently by dividing it into multiple instances.\n\nTo resolve the issue, ensure that:\n- `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is correctly set to be a multiple of `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances`.\n- If you modify `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size`, do it in the configuration file before starting the server, and ensure it is in 1MB increments.\n- Check the current settings in your INI file and calculate if the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is indeed a multiple of `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size * innodb_buffer_pool_instances`. If not, adjust accordingly.\n\nRecommended parameters to adjust or verify based on your scenario:\n```json\n[\"innodb_buffer_pool_size\", \"innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size\", \"innodb_buffer_pool_instances\"]\n```"}
