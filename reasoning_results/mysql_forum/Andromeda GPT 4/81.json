{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where a user can log in but cannot execute DML/DDL statements despite having the necessary permissions, it seems like the issue might be related to the initial connection settings or specific restrictions applied to the user at the time of connection. The parameters that could be relevant in this context, considering the information provided in the manuals and previous user questions, are:\n\n1. `init_connect` - This parameter is used to specify a set of commands that are executed for each client when the connection is established. If there's an issue with permissions or execution of statements, ensuring that `init_connect` does not contain commands that might restrict user activities could be important.\n\n2. `authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn` - Although this might not directly relate to the execution of DML/DDL statements, if your environment uses LDAP for authentication, ensuring that the configuration is correct can help in troubleshooting connection and permission issues.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to check or modify in your case would be:\n\n```json\n['init_connect', 'authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn']\n```"}
