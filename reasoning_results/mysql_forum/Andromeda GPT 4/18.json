{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where the issue is that all tables are being created as MyISAM despite needing them to be InnoDB (especially due to the use of foreign keys), the relevant parameter to address this issue would be:\n\n- `innodb_file_per_table`: This parameter ensures that each InnoDB table has its own .ibd file, which can be important for managing large databases and ensuring that InnoDB tables are handled correctly.\n\nHowever, the core issue seems to be that tables are defaulting to MyISAM instead of InnoDB. This might be influenced by the default storage engine setting in MySQL. Therefore, another relevant parameter to consider would be:\n\n- `default_storage_engine`: Setting this parameter to 'InnoDB' in your MySQL configuration will ensure that tables are created as InnoDB by default unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven the information and the parameters discussed in the manuals and previous questions, the recommended parameters to resolve your issue would be:\n\n```json\n['innodb_file_per_table', 'default_storage_engine']\n```"}
