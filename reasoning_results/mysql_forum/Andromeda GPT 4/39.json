{"res": "Based on the scenario described in your query, where you are dealing with a large volume of inserts and are considering the use of transactions to manage commits more efficiently, the relevant parameters from the provided documentation and user questions are:\n\n- `autocommit`\n\nThis parameter is directly mentioned in your scenario, where you are considering turning off autocommit to handle a large batch of inserts as a single transaction. This approach can indeed reduce the overhead of committing each insert individually, which can be beneficial for performance when dealing with such a large volume of data.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameter for your query is:\n\n```json\n[\"autocommit\"]\n```"}
