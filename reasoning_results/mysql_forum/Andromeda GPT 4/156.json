{"res": "Based on the scenario described and the available parameters from the reference questions and manuals, the following MySQL configuration parameters are recommended to optimize the server performance for the described VPS with a 2000 Mb of RAM and a 500 Mb database:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Increasing this parameter can significantly improve the performance for InnoDB tables by reducing disk I/O. Given the server has 2GB of RAM and the database size is 500MB, setting this to a value that uses a substantial portion of the RAM while leaving enough for other processes and the OS is crucial. A recommended setting might be around 1GB if the server is dedicated mostly to MySQL.\n\n2. **key_buffer_size**: This parameter is important for MyISAM tables. If your database uses MyISAM tables, increasing this can improve index read performance. However, if InnoDB is primarily used, this parameter should be kept minimal.\n\n3. **query_cache_size**: (Note: As of MySQL 5.7.20, the query cache is deprecated. If using an older version, this can be useful). This parameter allows storing the result set of frequent queries in memory. Setting this appropriately can reduce the load on the database by serving cached results of common queries.\n\n4. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. Queries that use temporary tables for storing intermediate results can benefit from adjustments to these parameters.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter improves performance by reusing threads rather than creating new ones for each new connection. This can reduce the overhead of connection handling, especially in an environment with frequent new connections.\n\n6. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value increases the number of open tables for all threads. This is useful if your application accesses many tables.\n\n7. **read_buffer_size**: This parameter affects sequential scan operations. If your workload involves a lot of table scans, adjusting this might help.\n\n8. **sort_buffer_size**: This is used for sorts for ORDER BY and GROUP BY operations. If queries involve a lot of sorting, increasing this might improve performance.\n\n9. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter can be adjusted to trade off reliability for performance. Setting it to 2 can improve performance but with a slight risk of data loss in case of a crash.\n\n10. **innodb_log_file_size**: Larger log files reduce the need for writing the log to disk frequently, which can improve performance but might increase recovery time after a crash.\n\nGiven the parameters and the scenario, the recommended configuration adjustments are:\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\"\n]\n```\nThese adjustments should help in optimizing MySQL performance on the described VPS setup."}
