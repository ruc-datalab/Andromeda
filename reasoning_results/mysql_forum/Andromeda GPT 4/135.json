{"res": "Based on the description of your issue where the 'id' column values are not incrementing by 1 as expected, it seems that the problem might be related to how the auto-increment values are being handled in your database. The parameters that could influence this behavior are:\n\n- `auto_increment_increment`: This parameter determines the increment between successive AUTO_INCREMENT values.\n- `auto_increment_offset`: This parameter sets the starting point for AUTO_INCREMENT values.\n\nThese parameters are relevant because they directly affect how the auto-increment functionality behaves in your database. If these are set incorrectly or to values other than the default (which is 1 for both), it could lead to unexpected increments in the 'id' values as you described.\n\nTherefore, the recommended parameters to check and possibly adjust in your scenario are:\n\n```json\n['auto_increment_increment', 'auto_increment_offset']\n```"}
