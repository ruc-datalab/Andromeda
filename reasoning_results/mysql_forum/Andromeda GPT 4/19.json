{"res": "Based on the details provided in your query and the issues you are facing with collations in MySQL, the following parameters are recommended to address the collation issues:\n\n1. **`character_set_connection`** - This parameter sets the character set for the current connection. Setting this to a consistent character set across your application and database can help avoid collation conflicts.\n\n2. **`collation_connection`** - This parameter sets the collation for the current connection. It is important to ensure that this is set to a collation that matches the character set and is compatible with the data stored in your database tables.\n\n3. **`character_set_client`** - This parameter sets the character set for the client. This should match the character set used in your database or be compatible with it to avoid issues during data retrieval and storage.\n\n4. **`collation_server`** - This parameter sets the default server collation. Adjusting this to match the collation of your database or tables can help resolve issues related to collation mismatches.\n\nThese parameters should be configured to ensure consistency across your database server, client connections, and individual client settings to prevent the \"Illegal mix of collations\" error you are encountering.\n\nRecommended parameters list:\n```json\n['character_set_connection', 'collation_connection', 'character_set_client', 'collation_server']\n```"}
