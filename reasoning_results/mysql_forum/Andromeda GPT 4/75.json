{"res": "The issue you're encountering with the `DeleteCountry` stored procedure not cascading deletes as expected, despite having the `ON DELETE CASCADE` rule set in your foreign key constraint, is likely due to the use of `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;` within the procedure. When you disable foreign key checks using `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;`, MySQL does not enforce foreign key constraints, including cascading deletes.\n\nThe correct behavior of cascading deletes should work without needing to disable the foreign key checks, provided that the foreign key constraints are properly set up and enabled. The use of `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;` is generally used to temporarily disable constraint checking for bulk loading operations or when you need to delete or modify data in a way that would normally violate a foreign key constraint.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you should remove the line `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;` from your stored procedure. This will ensure that the foreign key constraints, including the cascading deletes, are enforced when you delete a country. Here's the revised stored procedure:\n\n```sql\nDELIMITER //\nCREATE PROCEDURE DeleteCountry(IN counId SMALLINT)\nBEGIN\n    DELETE FROM COUNTRY WHERE COUNTRY_ID = counId;\nEND //\nDELIMITER ;\n```\n\nThis procedure should correctly cascade the delete operation to the `region` table as defined by your foreign key constraint. If the cascade is still not occurring, ensure that:\n\n1. The foreign key constraint is correctly defined and enabled.\n2. There are no other triggers or procedures that might be interfering with the operation.\n3. The `country_id` values in the `region` table correctly reference the `country_id` values in the `country` table.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, it might be useful to check the integrity of your database and the specific foreign key relationships.\n\nRecommended parameters based on your query and the context provided would be:\n- ['foreign_key_checks']\n\nThis parameter is crucial for managing how MySQL handles foreign key constraint checking."}
