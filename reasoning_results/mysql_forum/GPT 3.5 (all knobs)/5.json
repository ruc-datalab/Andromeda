{"res": "Based on your issue with active tables getting corrupted during MySQL shutdown or restart, I recommend focusing on the following parameters:\n\n1. `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`: This parameter controls the log flushing behavior for InnoDB tables. Setting it to a value of 0 can improve performance but may increase the risk of data loss in case of a crash. You can experiment with different values to find the right balance between performance and data integrity.\n\n2. `innodb_fast_shutdown`: This parameter controls the shutdown behavior of InnoDB. Setting it to a value of 2 can help speed up the shutdown process but may increase the risk of data corruption. You can try setting it to a value of 1 for a more controlled shutdown.\n\n3. `innodb_force_recovery`: This parameter can be used to force InnoDB recovery in case of corruption. You can try setting it to a value of 1 or higher to see if it helps recover the corrupted table during startup.\n\n4. `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown`: This parameter controls whether the InnoDB buffer pool should be dumped to disk during shutdown. Setting it to a value of 1 can help speed up the recovery process during startup.\n\n5. `innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup`: This parameter controls whether the InnoDB buffer pool should be loaded from disk during startup. Setting it to a value of 1 can help improve startup performance.\n\nPlease note that changing these parameters can have an impact on the overall performance and data integrity of your MySQL server, so it's important to test them in a controlled environment before applying them to a production system."}
