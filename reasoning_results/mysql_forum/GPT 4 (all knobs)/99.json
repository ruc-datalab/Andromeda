{"res": "Based on the detailed description of the issue you're facing with sleeping connections that do not release locks, leading to a lock on the entire database, and considering the parameters you've provided in your configuration file, here are some MySQL parameters that might be relevant to address or investigate the issue further:\n\n1. **wait_timeout** - This parameter defines the amount of time that MySQL will wait before it automatically closes a connection if it has been idle (i.e., not been used) for that duration. Adjusting this might help in automatically disconnecting sleeping connections that are holding locks.\n\n2. **interactive_timeout** - Similar to `wait_timeout`, but specifically for interactive sessions. Ensuring this is set appropriately can help manage idle sessions more effectively.\n\n3. **max_connections** - Although you have this set to a high value (1000), ensuring that this setting is optimal can help manage the number of concurrent connections and prevent excessive sleeping connections.\n\n4. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout** - This parameter sets the duration in seconds an InnoDB transaction waits for a row lock before giving up. Reviewing this setting might help if transactions are waiting excessively due to locked rows.\n\n5. **innodb_rollback_on_timeout** - If set to `ON`, this causes InnoDB to roll back the entire transaction if a timeout occurs on a single statement. This might help in scenarios where a transaction is left open and holding locks.\n\n6. **log_warnings** - Increasing the verbosity of this parameter might help identify issues in the logs that are related to the locking behavior.\n\n7. **innodb_print_all_deadlocks** - Enabling this parameter logs all deadlocks in InnoDB to the error log, helping identify what transactions were involved in the deadlock.\n\n8. **slave_net_timeout** - Since you mentioned issues with replication when these locks occur, adjusting this parameter might help in detecting and resolving issues faster in a master/master replication setup.\n\n9. **innodb_autoinc_lock_mode** - Adjusting this setting can change the behavior of how InnoDB handles auto-increment locking and might indirectly affect how locks are managed during inserts.\n\n10. **transaction_isolation** - Reviewing the transaction isolation level might provide insights if the isolation level is contributing to the locking behavior.\n\n11. **skip_name_resolve** - If DNS resolution issues are causing delays or connectivity issues, disabling name resolution might help.\n\n12. **binlog_error_action** - Since you are using replication, ensuring that this setting is configured correctly can help manage what actions are taken when a binlog error occurs.\n\n13. **innodb_deadlock_detect** - Ensures that deadlock detection is enabled in InnoDB, which can help the database resolve deadlocks more efficiently.\n\n14. **innodb_status_output_locks** - Enabling this can provide more detailed output in the InnoDB monitor output about the locks held by transactions.\n\nThese parameters can be adjusted to help diagnose or mitigate the issues you're experiencing with locks not being released by sleeping connections. It's important to test changes in a controlled environment before applying them in production to understand their impact."}
