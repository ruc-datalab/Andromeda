{"res": "Based on the description of your issue, it seems like the problem might be related to MySQL's authentication and caching mechanisms. The error message 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)' typically indicates issues with user authentication. Since connecting through MySQL Workbench temporarily resolves the issue, it suggests that there might be a problem with how user credentials are cached or how the authentication plugin is handling connections immediately after a restart.\n\nHere are some MySQL parameters that could potentially influence this behavior and might be worth examining or adjusting:\n\n1. `default_authentication_plugin` - This parameter determines the authentication plugin that will be used by MySQL. Since MySQL 8.0 uses `caching_sha2_password` as the default authentication plugin, ensure your PHP environment supports it, or switch to `mysql_native_password` if necessary.\n\n2. `skip_name_resolve` - If this is enabled, MySQL avoids DNS lookup. Sometimes DNS issues can cause problems with user authentication. Disabling this might help if DNS resolution is problematic.\n\n3. `auto_generate_certs` - If enabled, MySQL automatically generates SSL certificates at startup. This could potentially delay the readiness of the server right after a restart.\n\n4. `log_error_verbosity` - Increase the verbosity of error logging to get more detailed information about what might be going wrong during the connection attempts.\n\n5. `connect_timeout` - This parameter specifies the number of seconds that the mysqld server waits for a connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'. It might not be directly related but can be useful if the issue is due to initial connection timeouts after a restart.\n\n6. `authentication_windows_use_principal_name` - If using Windows authentication, this setting determines how the user name is retrieved. It's not directly related to your issue but could be relevant in a broader troubleshooting context.\n\n7. `innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup` - If set to ON, InnoDB loads the buffer pool's state from disk at startup, which can slow down the initial connection. This is more of a performance-related setting but could impact initial connections post-restart.\n\nGiven these parameters, the list for your output would be:\n\n```json\n['default_authentication_plugin', 'skip_name_resolve', 'auto_generate_certs', 'log_error_verbosity', 'connect_timeout', 'authentication_windows_use_principal_name', 'innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup']\n```\n\nThese parameters might help in diagnosing or mitigating the issue, although the exact solution could depend on other factors not covered in your initial description. Adjusting these settings should be done cautiously and ideally in a testing environment before applying to production."}
