{"res": "In your situation, where you are facing encoding issues after transferring your site and its data from one hosting environment to another, the primary concern is ensuring that the character set and collation settings are correctly configured to handle the cp1251 encoding in your MySQL database. Here are the relevant MySQL parameters that you should consider adjusting to resolve the encoding issues:\n\n1. **`character_set_client`**: This parameter sets the character set for the client. It should match the encoding of the data being sent by the client (your website).\n\n2. **`character_set_connection`**: This parameter sets the character set for the connection. It should be set to cp1251 if you are receiving data in that character set.\n\n3. **`character_set_database`**: This parameter sets the character set used by the default database. It should be set to cp1251 to match your data's encoding.\n\n4. **`character_set_results`**: This parameter sets the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. This should also be set to cp1251 to ensure that data is correctly encoded when sent back to the client.\n\n5. **`character_set_server`**: This parameter sets the server\u2019s default character set. Setting this to cp1251 can help ensure that all new databases and tables use cp1251 by default.\n\n6. **`collation_connection`**: This parameter sets the collation for the connection, which affects sorting and comparison operations. It should be set to cp1251_general_ci to match your database collation.\n\n7. **`collation_database`**: This parameter sets the collation for the database. Ensure it matches the collation used in your tables, cp1251_general_ci.\n\n8. **`collation_server`**: This parameter sets the default collation for the server. Setting this to cp1251_general_ci can help ensure that all new databases and tables use this collation by default.\n\nHere is the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_database', 'character_set_results', 'character_set_server', 'collation_connection', 'collation_database', 'collation_server']\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should help resolve the encoding issues you're experiencing by ensuring that the MySQL server handles character sets and collations correctly for your cp1251 encoded data."}
