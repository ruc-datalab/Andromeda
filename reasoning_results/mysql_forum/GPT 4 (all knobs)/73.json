{"res": "Based on your description, it seems that the issue you're experiencing might be related to how the server logs the database name in the `general_log`. The change in the case of the database name from \"Mysql\" to \"mysql\" in the logs could be influenced by the server's settings related to case sensitivity or the logging format. Here are a few parameters that might be relevant to investigate:\n\n1. **`lower_case_table_names`**: This parameter determines whether table names are stored in lowercase on disk and how table name comparisons are performed. It is also relevant for database names. If set to a non-zero value, it might cause the database name to be logged in lowercase.\n\n2. **`log_output`**: This parameter determines the destination of log output (file, table, or none). Changes or differences in how logs are handled might affect the appearance of data in logs.\n\n3. **`general_log`**: This parameter enables or disables the general query log that records every SQL query received from clients. The format or content might change based on other settings.\n\n4. **`character_set_server`**: This parameter sets the default server character set. While it's less likely, character set configurations might impact how data is logged or displayed.\n\n5. **`collation_server`**: Similar to `character_set_server`, this sets the default server collation. It's a long shot, but collation settings might have subtle effects on logging behavior.\n\n6. **`sql_mode`**: This parameter defines the SQL mode of the server. Certain modes can affect how SQL syntax is interpreted and potentially how operations are logged.\n\nHere's the list based on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n['lower_case_table_names', 'log_output', 'general_log', 'character_set_server', 'collation_server', 'sql_mode']\n```"}
