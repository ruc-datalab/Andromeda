{"res": "To set up data replication in MySQL with the ability to periodically purge data from the replicated server, you will need to configure several parameters related to replication and potentially some additional mechanisms for data purging. Here are the relevant MySQL parameters and suggestions for achieving your objective:\n\n1. **log_bin** - Enables binary logging on the master, which is necessary for replication.\n2. **server_id** - Unique identifier for each server in the replication setup; must be different for the master and the replica.\n3. **read_only** - Set this on the replica to prevent changes that are not part of the replication process.\n4. **replicate_do_db** or **replicate_wild_do_table** - Specifies which databases or tables to replicate.\n5. **expire_logs_days** - Automatically purges binary logs after a given number of days on the master.\n\nFor purging old data on the replicated server:\n- You will not directly use a MySQL parameter to purge data. Instead, schedule a periodic task (e.g., a cron job) that runs a SQL `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` command to remove data older than a certain number of days based on your requirements. This task can be a script that connects to the database and executes the necessary SQL commands.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- **slave_skip_errors** - Optional, allows the replica to skip certain types of errors.\n- **log_slave_updates** - If set to `ON`, the replica logs the changes it receives from the master into its own binary log, which can be useful if chaining replication.\n\nHere's the list of parameters you might consider setting:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"log_bin\",\n    \"server_id\",\n    \"read_only\",\n    \"replicate_do_db\",\n    \"replicate_wild_do_table\",\n    \"expire_logs_days\",\n    \"slave_skip_errors\",\n    \"log_slave_updates\"\n]\n```\n\nFor the data purging mechanism, you will need to implement a custom script or application logic outside of MySQL's configuration parameters. This script should be scheduled to run at intervals that match your reporting requirements (e.g., daily, weekly) to remove data older than the desired threshold."}
