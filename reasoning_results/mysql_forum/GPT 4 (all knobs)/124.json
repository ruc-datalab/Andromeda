{"res": "Based on the user's description and the provided INI file, it seems the user is having trouble with the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` setting, particularly in relation to `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size`. The user mentions that MySQL will not restart after changes are made directly in the INI file, and there is a need to ensure that the buffer pool size is a multiple of the chunk size. Here are the relevant parameters to focus on:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter defines the total size of the buffer pool, where InnoDB caches table and index data. The user has set this to 128M in the INI file.\n\n2. **innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size** - This parameter defines the size of each chunk in the buffer pool. It is not explicitly set in the INI file, which might be causing issues if the default chunk size does not divide the total buffer pool size evenly.\n\n3. **innodb_buffer_pool_instances** - This parameter defines the number of regions the buffer pool is divided into. It is set to 8 in the INI file.\n\nTo resolve the user's issue, ensure that the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is a multiple of `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size` and that the chunk size divides evenly into the buffer pool size given the number of instances. If `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size` is not set, it defaults to a value that might not necessarily divide the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` evenly, especially with multiple instances.\n\nHere are the parameters to adjust or verify:\n\n```plaintext\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size', 'innodb_buffer_pool_instances']\n```\n\nThese adjustments should help in resolving the startup issue with MySQL after modifying the INI file."}
