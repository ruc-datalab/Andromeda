{"res": "Based on the details provided in your question, the issue you're encountering with MySQL collations seems to stem from a mismatch between the collations of the columns involved in the query and the literals or variables used in the query. Since you are using MySQL version 4.1.8-nt, many of the newer parameters and features available in later versions of MySQL are not applicable. However, we can focus on the parameters related to character sets and collations that might be relevant to your version.\n\nHere are the parameters that could potentially influence the behavior you're experiencing, especially regarding collation and character set settings:\n\n1. **`character_set_client`** - This parameter sets the character set for the client. This is the character set in which statements are sent to the server from the client.\n\n2. **`character_set_connection`** - This parameter sets the character set for the connection. This is the character set used for literals that do not have a character set introducer and for number-to-string conversion.\n\n3. **`character_set_results`** - This parameter determines the character set in which the server returns query results to the client. This includes result data such as the values of columns of string types.\n\n4. **`collation_connection`** - This parameter sets the collation of the connection. This collation is used for comparisons of literals and for comparison of operation results where the arguments have string types.\n\n5. **`collation_server`** - This sets the server\u2019s default collation.\n\nThese settings can be adjusted to ensure that the connection, client, and server are using compatible character sets and collations, which should help resolve the issues with illegal mix of collations in your queries. Here's how you might set these parameters in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf`) or dynamically using the `SET` command in a session:\n\n```sql\nSET NAMES 'utf8' COLLATE 'utf8_general_ci';\nSET character_set_connection = 'utf8';\nSET character_set_results = 'utf8';\nSET collation_connection = 'utf8_general_ci';\n```\n\nThese commands configure the session to use UTF-8 for the character set and `utf8_general_ci` for the collation, which should help standardize the handling of characters and collations across different parts of your application and database.\n\nPlease output the list as requested:\n\n```json\n[\"character_set_client\", \"character_set_connection\", \"character_set_results\", \"collation_connection\", \"collation_server\"]\n```"}
