{"res": "The error \"MySQL server has gone away\" typically indicates that the server timed out and closed the connection. In your case, this is likely due to the large size of the records in the dump file. To address this issue, you can adjust the following MySQL server parameters to allow for handling larger packets and to prevent timeouts during the long load operation:\n\n1. `max_allowed_packet` - Increase this value to accommodate the size of your largest record. Since you mentioned records as large as 5MB, setting this parameter to a larger value (e.g., 16MB or 32MB) might be necessary.\n2. `net_read_timeout` - Increase this value to allow more time for reading data from the network, especially useful if the network is slow or if large amounts of data are being sent.\n3. `net_write_timeout` - Increase this value to allow more time for writing data to the network.\n4. `wait_timeout` - Increase this value to prevent the server from closing the connection too quickly during idle periods in the data transfer.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n['max_allowed_packet', 'net_read_timeout', 'net_write_timeout', 'wait_timeout']\n```"}
