{"res": "Based on your scenario where you are inserting a large volume of rows in a single transaction, turning off `autocommit` and performing a manual `COMMIT` at the end of the transaction is indeed a valid approach. This method can help in reducing the I/O overhead associated with committing each individual insert operation to the log, which can be beneficial for performance when dealing with large data volumes.\n\nHere are the relevant parameters and considerations for your scenario:\n\n1. **`autocommit`**: Setting this to 0 as you have done disables automatic commits after each statement, allowing you to manually control when the transaction commits. This is beneficial in batch insert operations as it reduces the number of disk writes.\n\n2. **`innodb_log_buffer_size`**: This parameter determines the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger log buffer allows more data to be held in memory before being flushed to disk, which can be beneficial in large transaction scenarios like yours.\n\n3. **`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`**: This parameter controls the balance between strict ACID compliance and higher performance. Setting it to 2, for example, can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file but not forcing a flush to disk on every commit. However, this can risk up to one second of transactions in case of a power failure.\n\n4. **`max_allowed_packet`**: Ensure this value is large enough to handle the data volume in your transactions, especially since you are selecting a large amount of data to insert at once.\n\n5. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: This should be sized appropriately to hold a significant portion of your data and indexes in memory, reducing I/O operations for both read and write operations.\n\n6. **`binlog_format`**: If binary logging is enabled (for replication or backup purposes), consider the impact of large transactions on binary logs. Row-based logging (`ROW`) might increase the log volume significantly for large transactions.\n\nHere is the list of parameters based on your description and needs:\n\n```json\n['autocommit', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit', 'max_allowed_packet', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'binlog_format']\n```\n\nRegarding the risks, the primary concern with large transactions is the potential for high memory usage and increased rollback segment size, which can impact performance if the transaction needs to be rolled back. Additionally, large transactions can hold locks for extended periods, potentially blocking other transactions and affecting concurrency. Always ensure that your system has adequate resources to handle such large transactions without affecting overall stability and performance."}
