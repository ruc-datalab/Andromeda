{"res": "To address the issue you're encountering with InnoDB when trying to set up a parallel MySQL instance for backup restoration, it seems like the problem is related to how InnoDB handles tablespace files. The error message suggests that there might be issues with the tablespace files not being recognized correctly in the new environment. Here are some MySQL configuration parameters that might help you manage and troubleshoot this situation:\n\n1. **`innodb_file_per_table`**: This parameter enables or disables the creation of a separate .ibd file for each InnoDB table. When enabled, it might help manage tablespace files more effectively during backups and restores.\n\n2. **`innodb_force_recovery`**: This parameter can be used to start InnoDB in a recovery mode when it cannot start normally. Useful for forcing a recovery if there are issues with the tablespaces.\n\n3. **`innodb_import_table_from_xtrabackup`**: If using Percona XtraBackup, this parameter can help with importing tablespaces.\n\n4. **`innodb_strict_mode`**: Enabling this can help avoid creating tablespaces that cannot be recovered.\n\n5. **`innodb_undo_directory`**: Specifies the directory where the undo tablespace files are located, which might be useful if the errors are related to undo logs.\n\n6. **`innodb_undo_tablespaces`**: Defines the number of undo tablespaces. Adjusting this might help manage undo tablespaces better during backups and restores.\n\n7. **`innodb_data_home_dir`**: This parameter sets the directory for the InnoDB data files. Ensuring this is correctly set in your parallel setup might resolve file path issues.\n\n8. **`innodb_log_group_home_dir`**: This sets the directory for InnoDB log files. Similar to `innodb_data_home_dir`, ensuring this is correctly set can help avoid issues with log files not being found.\n\n9. **`innodb_use_native_aio`**: This relates to the use of Linux native asynchronous I/O. Disabling it might help if there are I/O related issues in certain environments.\n\n10. **`innodb_read_only`**: Enables read-only mode for InnoDB, which could be useful for troubleshooting without risking further changes to the data.\n\nHere's the list formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n['innodb_file_per_table', 'innodb_force_recovery', 'innodb_import_table_from_xtrabackup', 'innodb_strict_mode', 'innodb_undo_directory', 'innodb_undo_tablespaces', 'innodb_data_home_dir', 'innodb_log_group_home_dir', 'innodb_use_native_aio', 'innodb_read_only']\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust these parameters carefully and test in a development environment before applying changes in production."}
