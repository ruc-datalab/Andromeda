{"res": "To address the issue of not having enough memory to allocate the insert buffer during data migration from MSSQL to MySQL, you might need to consider adjusting several parameters related to memory management and buffer sizes in MySQL. Since increasing `bulk_insert_buffer_size` alone did not resolve the issue, here are some other parameters you might consider tuning:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. Increasing this might help if your workload is InnoDB-heavy and you are running into memory issues.\n\n2. **max_allowed_packet** - This parameter sets the maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string. The migration process might be generating large packets that exceed the current limit.\n\n3. **innodb_log_buffer_size** - This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger size can reduce disk I/O by allowing InnoDB to write larger chunks of data at a time.\n\n4. **key_buffer_size** - If your tables use the MyISAM storage engine, increasing this parameter allocates more memory for MyISAM indexes.\n\n5. **read_buffer_size** - This parameter defines the size of the buffer that is allocated for reading rows from MyISAM tables. If your migration involves reading large tables, consider increasing this size.\n\n6. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size** - These parameters control the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. MySQL uses these temporary tables for operations such as sorting and query results. Increasing these might help if the migration process uses complex queries that require large temporary tables.\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"max_allowed_packet\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should be done cautiously and typically requires restarting the MySQL server. It's also recommended to monitor the system's performance and adjust these values incrementally to find the optimal settings for your specific workload."}
