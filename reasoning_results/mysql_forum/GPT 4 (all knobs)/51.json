{"res": "Based on the detailed error log and the symptoms described, it appears that your MySQL database, particularly the InnoDB engine, is experiencing issues likely related to data corruption or incomplete transactions due to the abrupt power failure. The errors and behaviors, such as issues with writing to tables and problems during `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, suggest that the database's internal structures might be compromised.\n\nTo address these issues, you should consider the following parameters to help recover the database and prevent further data loss:\n\n1. **`innodb_force_recovery`**: This parameter is crucial for forcing the InnoDB engine to start up while preventing background operations that could lead to further corruption. Start with a lower level of recovery (e.g., 1 or 2), which allows you to safely dump your tables. Be cautious with higher levels as they prevent more types of operations.\n\n2. **`innodb_file_per_table`**: If not already enabled, consider turning this on after recovery. It helps manage corruption by isolating each table into its own file, making recovery easier and limiting potential corruption to individual tables rather than the entire database.\n\n3. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Ensure this is adequately sized to hold your data in memory for efficient access, but also consider that too large a buffer pool might lead to longer recovery times in case of a crash.\n\n4. **`innodb_log_file_size`** and **`innodb_log_buffer_size`**: These parameters should be configured to ensure that changes are written to disk efficiently and safely. A larger log file size can handle more data changes but might increase recovery time, whereas the log buffer size helps buffer writes to the log files.\n\n5. **`max_allowed_packet`**: Increase this if the errors during `mysqldump` or `OPTIMIZE TABLE` are related to packet size, especially if you have BLOB or large text fields in your tables.\n\n6. **`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`**: Adjust this if transactions are timing out during recovery operations. This gives transactions a longer time to complete before being forcibly rolled back.\n\n7. **`innodb_io_capacity`** and **`innodb_io_capacity_max`**: These settings can be adjusted based on your disk's I/O capabilities, which might help in managing how InnoDB performs file reads and writes, especially during recovery operations.\n\n8. **`innodb_purge_threads`**: If the purge operations are contributing to performance issues or crashes, adjusting the number of threads dedicated to this process might help.\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation and the potential for data loss, consider the following steps:\n- Start with `innodb_force_recovery=1` and attempt to dump all tables.\n- If unsuccessful, incrementally increase the recovery level, understanding the risks at each level.\n- Once data is safely dumped, consider restoring it to a fresh instance with optimal settings based on your workload and observations from the current issues.\n\nPlease ensure you have backups of all data before attempting recovery operations, and consider performing these actions during a maintenance window to avoid further disruptions.\n\nRecommended parameters for recovery mode:\n```json\n['innodb_force_recovery', 'innodb_file_per_table', 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'innodb_log_file_size', 'innodb_log_buffer_size', 'max_allowed_packet', 'innodb_lock_wait_timeout', 'innodb_io_capacity', 'innodb_io_capacity_max', 'innodb_purge_threads']\n```"}
