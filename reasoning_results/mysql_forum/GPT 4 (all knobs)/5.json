{"res": "To safely shutdown or restart MySQL to prevent corruption of active tables, particularly those under heavy use like your forum's posts table, you should consider setting the following parameters:\n\n1. **innodb_fast_shutdown**: This parameter controls the InnoDB shutdown process. Setting it to `0` ensures that InnoDB performs a full purge and change buffer merge before shutting down, which can help prevent table corruption.\n\n2. **sync_binlog**: Setting this parameter to `1` ensures that the binary log is synchronized to disk before a transaction is committed, reducing the risk of data corruption on restart.\n\n3. **innodb_file_per_table**: Enabling this (set to `1`) ensures that each InnoDB table has its own file, which can help reduce the risk of corruption by isolating issues to individual tables.\n\n4. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Setting this to `1` ensures that the log buffer is written to the log file and flushed to disk at each transaction commit, providing ACID compliance and reducing the risk of corruption.\n\n5. **innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown**: Setting this to `1` enables the dumping of the buffer pool's dirty pages to disk on shutdown, ensuring that data is not lost and reducing startup time as well as the risk of corruption on restart.\n\n6. **innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup**: Setting this to `1` ensures that the buffer pool state is restored at startup, speeding up the process and reducing the risk of issues arising from a cold buffer pool.\n\nThese parameters help ensure data integrity during the shutdown process and minimize the risk of table corruption, especially for highly active tables.\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_fast_shutdown\",\n    \"sync_binlog\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup\"\n]\n```"}
