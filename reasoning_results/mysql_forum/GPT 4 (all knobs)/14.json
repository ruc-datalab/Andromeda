{"res": "To configure MySQL to run under your user account and avoid conflicts with the existing MySQL installation, you will need to adjust the following parameters in your MySQL configuration file (typically `my.cnf` or `my.ini`):\n\n1. **User ID (`user`)**: This parameter sets the Unix username to use when running the MySQL server. Since you are not root, you will set this to your username.\n\n2. **TCP Port (`port`)**: This parameter specifies the TCP/IP port on which the server listens for connections. You need to choose a port that does not conflict with the existing MySQL installation or any other applications.\n\n3. **Socket File (`socket`)**: This parameter specifies the Unix socket file that the server uses for connections on the local machine. It should be unique to avoid conflicts with the existing MySQL installation.\n\nHere is the list of parameters you should adjust:\n\n```json\n['user', 'port', 'socket']\n```"}
