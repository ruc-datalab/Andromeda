{"res": "Based on the provided configuration and the server specifications (IIS6 / Single-3.07GHz chip / 1GB RAM), it appears that the MySQL configuration might be over-allocated in terms of memory usage, which could be contributing to the high CPU usage. Here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your `my.ini` file to potentially improve performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is set quite high given the total RAM available. Reducing this might help in ensuring that the system isn't swapping, which can degrade performance.\n2. **query_cache_size**: While this is set to a reasonable size, it's worth noting that the query cache can sometimes degrade performance on highly concurrent systems. You might consider experimenting with disabling it (`query_cache_size=0`) to see if that impacts CPU usage.\n3. **thread_cache_size**: This setting is generally fine, but you might want to adjust it based on the number of connections.\n4. **max_connections**: Given the hardware, 300 might be too high unless all these connections are actively needed. Reducing this number might help manage resources better.\n5. **key_buffer_size**: This is set to 2M in your configuration, which is generally low, especially if MyISAM tables are in use. However, since your default storage engine is InnoDB, this setting is less critical unless you have MyISAM tables.\n6. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: These are generally fine, but you might want to ensure that the log file size is appropriate for the amount of transaction you handle.\n7. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Ensure these are aligned and not set too high to avoid excessive memory use for temporary tables.\n\nHere's a revised list of parameters to consider adjusting:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments are starting points. Monitoring the server's performance after making these changes will be crucial to determine if further tuning is necessary."}
