{"res": "It appears that your MySQL server is not enforcing SSL connections consistently across all connection types and interfaces. This inconsistency can occur due to various reasons, such as misconfiguration in user settings or MySQL not defaulting to SSL for certain types of connections (like those using IP addresses directly).\n\nTo ensure that SSL is required for all connections, including those made via IP addresses, you can adjust the following parameters in your MySQL configuration:\n\n1. **`require_secure_transport`**: This parameter ensures that MySQL accepts only connections that are encrypted. Setting this to `ON` will deny any connections that are not using SSL/TLS.\n\n2. **`ssl_ca`**, **`ssl_cert`**, and **`ssl_key`**: These parameters should already be set as you have configured SSL, but ensure they are correctly pointing to your certificate files.\n\n3. **User account SSL requirements**: As you've set up the user to require SSL, ensure that this requirement is enforced correctly by MySQL. Sometimes, the user creation syntax might slightly vary or have issues. Double-check the user creation and modification commands.\n\nHere is the correct syntax for creating a user that requires SSL:\n```sql\nCREATE USER 'test'@'%' REQUIRE SSL IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'test'@'%';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'password'` with the actual password you want to use.\n\nGiven your description, here are the recommended parameters to check and possibly adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"require_secure_transport\",\n    \"ssl_ca\",\n    \"ssl_cert\",\n    \"ssl_key\"\n]\n```\n\nEnsure that `require_secure_transport` is set to `ON` in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini` depending on your installation), and restart the MySQL server for changes to take effect. This should enforce SSL for all connections, including those made via IP addresses."}
