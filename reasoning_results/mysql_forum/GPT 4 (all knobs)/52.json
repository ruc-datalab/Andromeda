{"res": "Hello Enrique,\n\nThe significant difference in execution time for your query could be attributed to several factors, primarily related to how MySQL handles caching and the state of the database at the time of the queries. Here are some potential reasons and corresponding parameters that could influence the performance:\n\n1. **Buffer Pool Initialization**: The first time the query runs, if the data is not in the InnoDB buffer pool, it has to be read from disk, which is slower. Subsequent queries may run faster if the data is already loaded into the buffer pool.\n   - `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: Increasing this parameter can allocate more memory to the buffer pool, allowing more data to be cached in memory.\n\n2. **Query Cache**: If the query cache is enabled, the result of the query could be cached, making subsequent executions faster.\n   - `query_cache_size`: Adjusting this parameter can increase the amount of memory allocated to the query cache, improving performance for repeated queries. However, note that the query cache has been deprecated in MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0.\n\n3. **Table Statistics**: MySQL uses table statistics to optimize queries. If the statistics are outdated, the optimizer might not choose the best execution plan.\n   - `innodb_stats_on_metadata`: Setting this to OFF can prevent InnoDB from updating statistics when metadata statements are issued, potentially stabilizing execution plans.\n\n4. **Adaptive Hash Index**: This feature can speed up searches using equality operators by building a hash index on top of the B-tree index.\n   - `innodb_adaptive_hash_index`: Ensure this is enabled to allow InnoDB to adaptively create hash indexes on frequently accessed pages.\n\n5. **Configuration of InnoDB Logs**: The configuration of the InnoDB redo logs can also impact performance, particularly for write-heavy workloads.\n   - `innodb_log_file_size`: Ensuring that the log file size is appropriately configured for your workload can help in maintaining a balance between write performance and recovery time.\n\n6. **Concurrency and Threads**: The configuration related to how MySQL handles concurrency and threads can impact performance.\n   - `innodb_read_io_threads` and `innodb_write_io_threads`: Increasing these values can improve read and write performance by allowing more threads for I/O operations.\n   - `innodb_thread_concurrency`: This parameter can be adjusted to control the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently.\n\nGiven your scenario, here are the recommended parameters to consider tuning:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n  \"query_cache_size\",\n  \"innodb_stats_on_metadata\",\n  \"innodb_adaptive_hash_index\",\n  \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n  \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n  \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n  \"innodb_thread_concurrency\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should help in optimizing the performance of your query. However, always ensure to test changes in a staging environment before applying them to production to observe their impact and adjust accordingly."}
