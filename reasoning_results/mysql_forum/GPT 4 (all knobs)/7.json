{"res": "Based on your description, it seems like the MySQL server is not running properly after the restoration process, which could be why the `mysql.sock` and `mysql.pid` files are missing. These files are typically created when MySQL starts and are removed when it shuts down. If MySQL isn't running, these files won't exist.\n\nHere are some parameters and steps you might consider to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **`socket`**: This parameter specifies the path to the socket file used by MySQL for local connections. You should check your MySQL configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini`) to see if the socket is defined and points to the correct location.\n\n2. **`pid_file`**: This parameter specifies the path to the PID file that MySQL uses to store its process ID. Check the configuration file to ensure this path is correctly set and that MySQL has the necessary permissions to write to this location.\n\n3. **`log_error`**: This parameter specifies the error log file path. Reviewing the error log can provide insights into what might be going wrong with the MySQL server startup.\n\n4. **`datadir`**: This parameter specifies the directory that stores the database files. Ensure that this directory is correctly set in the configuration file and that it has the correct permissions.\n\n5. **`innodb_force_recovery`**: If MySQL is failing due to a corrupt InnoDB database, you might consider using this parameter to force a recovery. Start with a lower value (e.g., 1) and increase it if necessary, but be cautious as higher levels can lead to data loss.\n\nHere's a list of suggested parameters to check or modify in your configuration file based on the issues described:\n\n```json\n['socket', 'pid_file', 'log_error', 'datadir', 'innodb_force_recovery']\n```\n\nAdditionally, here are steps to approach the problem:\n\n1. **Check MySQL Service Status**: Use the command `sudo systemctl status mysql` to check if the MySQL service is running. If it's not, try to start it with `sudo systemctl start mysql`.\n\n2. **Review Logs**: Check the MySQL error logs as specified by the `log_error` parameter for any indications of why the server might not be starting.\n\n3. **Permissions**: Ensure that the directory for the PID file and socket file has the correct permissions and is owned by the MySQL user.\n\n4. **Configuration File**: Verify all paths in the MySQL configuration file are correct, especially for `socket`, `pid_file`, and `datadir`.\n\n5. **Recovery Mode**: If you suspect data corruption, cautiously use the `innodb_force_recovery` option to try to start MySQL in a recovery mode.\n\nBy following these steps and checking these parameters, you should be able to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue with MySQL not starting correctly on your server."}
