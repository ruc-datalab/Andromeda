{"res": "To permanently disable MySQL strict mode on your CentOS Linux 6.3 system running MySQL 5.5.27, you need to locate the correct configuration file and modify the `sql_mode` setting. Since you mentioned that you cannot find `my.ini`, it's likely that your MySQL installation is using a different configuration file, commonly `my.cnf` on Linux systems.\n\nHere are the steps and parameters you should consider:\n\n1. **Locate the Configuration File**: The default location for `my.cnf` in CentOS is typically `/etc/my.cnf`. If it's not there, you can try finding it using the `find` command:\n   ```bash\n   find / -name my.cnf\n   ```\n\n2. **Edit the Configuration File**: Once you locate the `my.cnf` file, open it with a text editor like `vi` or `nano`. You need to look for the `[mysqld]` section and modify the `sql_mode` parameter.\n\n3. **Modify sql_mode**: If `sql_mode` is set in the file, modify it to remove `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` or set it as desired. If it's not present, you can add it under the `[mysqld]` section:\n   ```ini\n   [mysqld]\n   sql_mode=\"\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart MySQL Service**: After saving the changes, restart the MySQL service to apply them:\n   ```bash\n   service mysqld restart\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Change**: Log into MySQL and check the `sql_mode` to ensure it's set as expected:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT @@sql_mode;\n   ```\n\nBased on your query, the relevant parameters to consider are:\n```json\n['sql_mode']\n```\n\nThese steps should help you permanently disable strict mode in MySQL on your CentOS server."}
