{"res": "For setting up a new user in a MySQL master-slave configuration, you should primarily focus on user management and replication settings. Here's a breakdown of where and how to create the user:\n\n1. **Create the User on the Master**: In a master-slave setup, all write operations (including user creation and privilege assignment) should be performed on the master server. This is because the master logs these changes, which are then replicated to the slave servers. If you create the user directly on the slave, it could lead to inconsistencies and replication errors unless the slave is set to read-only.\n\n2. **Ensure Replication of User Creation to Slaves**: When you create the user on the master, ensure that the replication process is active and correctly configured so that the user creation and privilege settings are replicated to the slave servers. This ensures that the user 'testapi' will exist with the same privileges on both the master and all slave servers.\n\nGiven your scenario, the relevant MySQL parameters and settings you might consider are related to replication and user privileges. However, since your question is more about operational steps rather than specific MySQL parameters to adjust, the direct answer involves actions rather than parameter settings. If you were to adjust parameters, they would typically involve ensuring that your replication settings are correct, but these are usually already set in a functioning master-slave setup.\n\nHere are some general MySQL parameters related to replication and security that you might review or use in other contexts, although they may not directly apply to just creating a user:\n- `log_bin` \u2013 Ensures binary logging is enabled, which is essential for replication.\n- `server_id` \u2013 Unique identifier for each server in a replication setup.\n- `read_only` \u2013 Often set on slaves to prevent direct write operations.\n- `super_read_only` \u2013 Can be used on slaves to prevent even users with SUPER privilege from performing write operations.\n- `replicate_do_db` \u2013 If set, restricts replication to specific databases.\n\nFor creating the user and setting privileges, you would typically use SQL commands rather than adjusting configuration parameters:\n```sql\nCREATE USER 'testapi'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON survey.* TO 'testapi'@'%';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\nThese commands should be run on the master server.\n\nIf you need to adjust specific MySQL parameters for other reasons related to this setup, please specify, and I can provide recommendations based on those needs."}
