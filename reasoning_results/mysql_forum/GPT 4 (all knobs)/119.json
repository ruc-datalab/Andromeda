{"res": "To address the query requirements described by Mahesh, where he wants to retrieve members on the LEFT and RIGHT side based on a specific Center ID, we need to focus on parameters that optimize query performance and handle hierarchical data efficiently in MySQL. The query involves recursive relationships and potentially complex joins to traverse the hierarchy of referrals. Here are the recommended MySQL parameters to optimize for such queries:\n\n1. **max_join_size**: This parameter determines the maximum allowable number of rows in a join. Since the query might involve multiple joins to traverse the hierarchy, setting this appropriately ensures that the server does not prevent large joins.\n\n2. **optimizer_switch**: This parameter allows enabling or disabling of various optimizer features. For recursive queries, ensuring that the optimizer is tuned for performance with joins can be beneficial.\n\n3. **cte_max_recursion_depth**: This parameter sets the maximum recursion depth for common table expressions (CTEs), which are useful for hierarchical queries like the one needed here. MySQL uses CTEs to handle recursive queries efficiently.\n\n4. **query_alloc_block_size**: This parameter adjusts the amount of memory allocated during query execution for storing intermediate results. Increasing this might help in complex queries.\n\n5. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: This parameter is used after a sort operation to read rows in sorted order. If the query involves sorting (e.g., by 'Side'), adjusting this buffer size might improve the read performance.\n\n6. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter sets the buffer size for sorting rows, which can be useful if the query involves sorting members based on their position (LEFT or RIGHT).\n\n7. **join_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer used for joins. Since the query might involve recursive joins, having a larger join buffer might improve performance.\n\n8. **max_recursive_iterations**: If available, this parameter would control the maximum number of iterations for recursive operations, useful in managing performance and preventing infinite loops in recursive queries.\n\n9. **thread_handling**: This parameter manages how threads are handled by MySQL. Optimizing thread handling can improve performance for complex queries executed concurrently.\n\n10. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Since the data retrieval is likely to be I/O intensive, ensuring that InnoDB's buffer pool is sufficiently large to cache data effectively is crucial.\n\nThese parameters focus on optimizing MySQL's performance for complex hierarchical queries, which involve recursion and potentially large joins. Adjusting these settings should be done cautiously and typically in a testing environment before applying to production, as they can affect overall server performance."}
