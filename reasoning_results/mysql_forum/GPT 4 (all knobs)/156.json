{"res": "Given the scenario you described, optimizing MySQL performance can indeed help reduce the stalling issue on the homepage requests. Here are some MySQL parameters you might consider tuning to enhance the performance of your server, especially with the available resources and the nature of the workload described:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This is the amount of memory allocated for InnoDB to cache its data and indexes. Since you have 1.75 GB of free RAM and a 500 MB database, you can allocate more memory to this buffer pool to ensure most of your data resides in memory, reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **query_cache_size**: Although deprecated in MySQL 8.0, if you're using an earlier version, increasing the query cache can help with read-heavy loads by caching the result set of frequent queries.\n\n3. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter determines how many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't too many threads already there.\n\n4. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value increases the number of open tables for all threads. It helps with performance by reducing the number of file opens and closes.\n\n5. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: This parameter can be set to 2 if durability can be slightly compromised for more speed. This setting will flush logs to disk every second instead of every transaction.\n\n6. **innodb_io_capacity**: Adjust this according to your system's I/O capacity. It specifies the I/O capacity of the storage device, which can be increased if your device supports higher I/O.\n\n7. **max_connections**: Ensure this is high enough to handle peak application connections, but not too high as it can lead to excessive memory use.\n\n8. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations in InnoDB. Increasing them can improve the I/O throughput.\n\n9. **innodb_file_per_table**: Enabling this option allows InnoDB to store data and indexes for each newly created table into separate files, which can improve management and performance.\n\n10. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: These parameters define the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. If an in-memory temporary table exceeds the size, it's converted to an on-disk table.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nBefore applying these changes, it's crucial to back up your database and test the configuration in a staging environment if possible. Monitor the changes closely to ensure they positively impact performance without straining server resources."}
