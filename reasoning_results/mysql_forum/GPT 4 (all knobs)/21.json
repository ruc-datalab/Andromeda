{"res": "Given your scenario and the performance issues you're experiencing with MySQL compared to MS SQL on the same hardware, there are several MySQL configuration parameters that could potentially be tuned to optimize performance for your specific workload. Here are some recommended parameters to consider adjusting:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This should be set to a large portion of your available memory since you have 512GB of RAM. Typically, setting this to about 70-80% of available memory is recommended for systems dedicated to MySQL.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing these can help speed up transaction processing by reducing disk I/O for log writes.\n\n3. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: Since you have a high-core count (80 cores), increasing these from their default values can help utilize your CPU resources better.\n\n4. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter can be increased to allow more concurrent threads within InnoDB, which might be beneficial given your server's high core count.\n\n5. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Setting this to 2 can improve performance at the risk of losing about one second worth of transactions in a crash. This setting is a trade-off between performance and ACID compliance.\n\n6. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Adjust these settings based on your disk's capabilities (IOPS). Since you're using a SAN with 15k SAS drives, these values can be increased to match the performance characteristics of your storage.\n\n7. **query_cache_size** (if using MySQL 5.6 or earlier): If your workload involves many identical queries, increasing the query cache might help, but this is often workload-specific and the query cache is deprecated in later versions.\n\n8. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this can reduce the overhead of opening tables, beneficial if you have many tables and a high volume of queries.\n\n9. **thread_cache_size**: This helps by reducing the overhead of creating new threads. Given your server's specifications, you might benefit from increasing this value.\n\n10. **max_connections**: Ensure this is high enough to handle your concurrent connections without being so high as to cause excessive overhead.\n\n11. **innodb_file_per_table**: This should be enabled to help manage large datasets more efficiently by storing each InnoDB table and its indexes in separate files.\n\n12. **innodb_stats_on_metadata**: Setting this to OFF can improve performance by reducing the need for InnoDB to update statistics during metadata statements.\n\nHere's the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n    \"innodb_stats_on_metadata\"\n]\n```\n\nThese parameters are a starting point based on your description. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance after making changes and adjust as necessary. Additionally, consider running comprehensive benchmarks to simulate your specific workloads for more targeted tuning."}
