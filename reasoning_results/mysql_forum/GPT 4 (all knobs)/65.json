{"res": "To help you identify the problematic lines in your data file during the MySQL load operation, you can adjust several MySQL server system variables to increase the verbosity of error and warning messages. Here are some parameters that might help you get more detailed feedback about what might be going wrong during the data load process:\n\n1. **`log_error_verbosity`**: This parameter controls the verbosity of the error log. Increasing its value can help in logging more detailed error information.\n\n2. **`general_log`**: Enabling this logs every general event, including each client connection and each SQL statement received from clients. This might help you trace the operations being performed.\n\n3. **`general_log_file`**: Specifies the file to which the general log is written. Ensure this is set if `general_log` is enabled.\n\n4. **`log_warnings`**: This system variable is deprecated in some versions and replaced by `log_error_verbosity`. It controls the generation of warning messages in error logs.\n\n5. **`show_warnings`**: Not a system variable but a command that can be used after running your load script to display warnings from the last command executed.\n\n6. **`sql_notes`**: This parameter controls whether to log notes. Notes often include issues that are not critical but could be informative for debugging.\n\nHere's the list of parameters formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n['log_error_verbosity', 'general_log', 'general_log_file', 'log_warnings', 'sql_notes']\n```\n\nMake sure to check the MySQL version documentation as some system variables might be deprecated or have changed in behavior across different versions. Adjusting these settings can help you get more detailed output that might reveal what's going wrong with your data load script."}
