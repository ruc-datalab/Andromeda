{"res": "To address the issue you're experiencing with the full-text search in MySQL not returning any results, you might need to check and possibly adjust several MySQL configuration parameters related to full-text search. Here are some parameters that could be relevant:\n\n1. **`ft_min_word_len`**: This parameter sets the minimum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index. If \"java\" is shorter than the current setting, it won't be indexed or searched.\n\n2. **`ft_max_word_len`**: This parameter sets the maximum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index. Ensure that the word \"java\" does not exceed this length.\n\n3. **`ft_boolean_syntax`**: This parameter defines the operators that can be used in a Boolean full-text search. Make sure the syntax used in your query matches what is configured.\n\n4. **`ft_stopword_file`**: The path to the file that contains the list of stopwords for full-text searches. If \"java\" is listed as a stopword, it will not be included in the FULLTEXT index.\n\n5. **`innodb_ft_min_token_size`** and **`innodb_ft_max_token_size`**: For InnoDB tables, these parameters determine the minimum and maximum length of the token that InnoDB indexes for FULLTEXT searches. Adjust these if your table uses InnoDB and \"java\" falls outside the current token size settings.\n\n6. **`innodb_ft_enable_stopword`**: This parameter controls whether InnoDB uses the built-in stopword list for FULLTEXT indexes. If enabled, and \"java\" is a stopword, it won't be searchable.\n\nHere's the list of parameters you might consider reviewing or adjusting based on your MySQL configuration and the specifics of your FULLTEXT search issue:\n\n```json\n['ft_min_word_len', 'ft_max_word_len', 'ft_boolean_syntax', 'ft_stopword_file', 'innodb_ft_min_token_size', 'innodb_ft_max_token_size', 'innodb_ft_enable_stopword']\n```\n\nMake sure to check the current values of these parameters in your MySQL configuration, and adjust them as needed to fit the requirements of your full-text search queries. After making changes, remember to rebuild your FULLTEXT indexes to apply the new settings."}
