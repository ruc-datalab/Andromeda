{"res": "To address the performance issues you're experiencing with your query, particularly the \"Copying to tmp table\" state and the use of \"filesort\" and \"temporary\" in your query execution, we need to consider several database parameters and indexing strategies. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Increase `sort_buffer_size` and `read_rnd_buffer_size`**: These parameters can help with sorting operations, which seem to be a bottleneck given the \"Using filesort\" in your EXPLAIN output.\n\n2. **Optimize `join_buffer_size`**: This parameter can be increased to improve the performance of joins that do not use indexes. Given your query structure and the EXPLAIN output, increasing this might help.\n\n3. **Review and optimize indexes**: The performance of your query can be significantly affected by the presence or absence of appropriate indexes. Ensure that indexes exist on columns used in joins and where conditions. For example, consider adding indexes on `notifications.instance_id`, `contactnotifications.notification_id`, and `contactnotificationmethods.contactnotification_id`.\n\n4. **Adjust `tmp_table_size` and `max_heap_table_size`**: Since you've already adjusted these, ensure they are sufficiently large to hold the temporary tables created by your query. However, be cautious as setting them too high might lead to excessive memory usage.\n\n5. **Enable `innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Although already quite large, ensure it is adequately sized to hold your working dataset, which can reduce disk I/O by keeping more data in memory.\n\n6. **Optimize MyISAM tables**: Since your tables are using the MyISAM storage engine, consider key optimizations specific to MyISAM like adjusting `key_buffer_size` to improve index read performance.\n\n7. **Convert tables to InnoDB**: If feasible, consider converting your MyISAM tables to InnoDB. InnoDB generally provides better performance for write-intensive applications and supports advanced features like row-level locking and transactions.\n\n8. **Query optimization**: Review the query to ensure it's written efficiently. For example, check if all joins are necessary and if conditions in the WHERE clause are sargable.\n\n9. **Hardware considerations**: Given the RAM size, ensure other system parameters are not bottlenecking the performance, like CPU and disk I/O.\n\n10. **Enable slow query log (`slow_query_log`)**: This can help identify and focus on optimizing the slowest queries.\n\n11. **Analyze and optimize table statistics**: Sometimes, the optimizer might choose inefficient query plans based on outdated table statistics. Use `ANALYZE TABLE` to update statistics for the optimizer.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust based on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"key_buffer_size\",\n    \"slow_query_log\"\n]\n```\n\nThese changes should help mitigate the issues you're facing with the specific query and improve overall database performance. Remember to make changes incrementally and monitor the impact to avoid over-allocation of resources."}
