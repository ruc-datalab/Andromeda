{"res": "To achieve the task of selecting rows with duplicated 'Horizon_SKU' values from a simple MySQL table, you don't need to adjust any specific database parameters directly related to the operation of querying or handling duplicates in SQL. The task can be accomplished using SQL queries, specifically leveraging GROUP BY and JOIN clauses or using window functions if supported.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for database parameters that could indirectly affect the performance or behavior of queries in general, here are a few that might be relevant, although they are not directly used to alter SQL query logic for finding duplicates:\n\n1. `innodb_buffer_pool_size` - Adjusts the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. Larger buffer pools can improve query performance by reducing disk I/O.\n2. `max_connections` - Determines the maximum number of simultaneous client connections. If you expect high concurrency, adjusting this might be necessary.\n3. `query_cache_size` - (Depreciated in some versions) Defines the amount of memory allocated for caching query results. Note that the query cache is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.\n4. `sort_buffer_size` - Each thread that performs a sort allocates a buffer of this size. Larger buffers can improve the speed of sorting operations, which might be involved when grouping and checking for duplicates.\n5. `read_buffer_size` - The size of the buffer used for full table scans, which might affect performance when checking large tables for duplicates without proper indexes.\n\nSince the task is primarily handled at the SQL query level, here's a basic example of how you might write the query to find duplicated 'Horizon_SKU':\n\n```sql\nSELECT t1.*\nFROM your_table t1\nJOIN (\n    SELECT Horizon_SKU\n    FROM your_table\n    GROUP BY Horizon_SKU\n    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n) t2 ON t1.Horizon_SKU = t2.Horizon_SKU;\n```\n\nThis SQL query does not require any specific MySQL parameters to be set but will benefit from a well-tuned MySQL server where parameters like those mentioned above are set appropriately based on the server's workload and hardware.\n\nTherefore, the list of potentially relevant parameters, considering general database performance and not specific to the query logic, would be:\n\n```json\n['innodb_buffer_pool_size', 'max_connections', 'query_cache_size', 'sort_buffer_size', 'read_buffer_size']\n```"}
