{"res": "The issue you're experiencing with the 'id' column values not incrementing by only 1 for each additional row when using the 'load data local infile' query in MariaDB can be related to the handling of auto-increment values during bulk inserts. This behavior can be influenced by several system variables related to auto-increment settings and bulk data loading. Here are some relevant parameters that might help you control or understand this behavior:\n\n1. `auto_increment_increment`: This parameter controls the increment between successive AUTO_INCREMENT values. By default, it is set to 1, but if it's set differently, it could cause unexpected increments.\n\n2. `auto_increment_offset`: This parameter determines the starting point for AUTO_INCREMENT columns. A different setting here might affect the initial value of the auto-increment.\n\n3. `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`: This parameter determines the lock mode used for generating auto-increment values. Different modes can affect how values are generated during concurrent inserts. For bulk inserts, setting this to a value like 2 (interleaved) might cause gaps in auto-increment values.\n\n4. `bulk_insert_buffer_size`: While not directly related to auto-increment issues, this parameter affects the efficiency of bulk insert operations and might indirectly influence how operations are batched and committed, potentially impacting auto-increment behavior.\n\nGiven your description, you might want to check the settings of these parameters:\n\n```json\n['auto_increment_increment', 'auto_increment_offset', 'innodb_autoinc_lock_mode', 'bulk_insert_buffer_size']\n```"}
