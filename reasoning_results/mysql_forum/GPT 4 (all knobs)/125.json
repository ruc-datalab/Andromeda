{"res": "The behavior you're observing where Chinese characters are converted into Unicode code points in the file system is due to how MySQL handles the encoding of filenames for databases and tables. This is particularly evident when using file systems that do not natively support Unicode characters in file names.\n\nMySQL converts the names of databases and tables to a form that can be used safely on any file system by encoding them using a specific scheme. Each character that is not a basic Latin letter or digit is encoded as `@xxxx`, where `xxxx` is the hexadecimal Unicode code point of the character. This ensures that the names can be used on file systems that do not support Unicode or have other restrictions.\n\nTo address your question, unfortunately, there is no MySQL server system variable that allows you to change this behavior directly. The encoding is hard-coded into how MySQL interacts with the file system for the purpose of ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and file systems.\n\nHowever, you can work around this by using only ASCII characters for database and table names if you need to have readable names in the file system. Alternatively, you can continue using Chinese characters in SQLyog or other client interfaces, which will display the names correctly, but the underlying file names will still use the encoded format.\n\nHere are some related parameters that deal with character sets and file handling, but none directly influence the naming convention on the file system:\n- `character_set_client`\n- `character_set_connection`\n- `character_set_filesystem`\n- `character_set_results`\n- `collation_connection`\n- `collation_server`\n\nThus, the output list, given your specific question, would be:\n```json\n['character_set_client', 'character_set_connection', 'character_set_filesystem', 'character_set_results', 'collation_connection', 'collation_server']\n```\nThese parameters are related to handling character sets within MySQL, which is tangentially related to your issue but does not provide a direct solution to the file naming behavior."}
