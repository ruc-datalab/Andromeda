{"res": "Based on the issues described, it seems that the MySQL database is facing severe corruption and instability issues. The parameters you've adjusted (`max_allowed_packet`, `net_write_timeout`, `key_buffer_size`) are generally useful but may not address deeper issues related to InnoDB corruption and recovery. Here are some parameters that might help in dealing with the corruption and import problems:\n\n1. **innodb_force_recovery**: You've used this to dump the table, but it might need adjustment during import or further operations to stabilize the server.\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: If the log file size is too small, it might cause issues during recovery or heavy transactions.\n3. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Ensuring this is adequately sized can help performance and stability, especially during recovery operations.\n4. **innodb_file_per_table**: This can help isolate corruption to individual tables rather than the entire database.\n5. **max_heap_table_size**: If temporary tables are becoming too large during the import, adjusting this might help.\n6. **tmp_table_size**: Similar to `max_heap_table_size`, ensuring this is large enough to handle operations during the import.\n7. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings can affect how InnoDB performs I/O operations, which might be crucial during recovery and import processes.\n8. **innodb_lock_wait_timeout**: If there are timeout issues during import, adjusting this might help.\n9. **innodb_strict_mode**: Disabling this might help bypass certain errors during import, but use with caution as it can allow unsafe operations.\n\nGiven the error messages and the context, these parameters might help address some of the underlying issues or at least provide more stability during recovery and import operations:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_force_recovery\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_file_per_table\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_lock_wait_timeout\",\n    \"innodb_strict_mode\"\n]\n```"}
