{"res": "Based on your description, it seems like the issue might be related to user privileges or specific settings that restrict the operations of non-root users. Here are some MySQL configuration parameters that could potentially influence the behavior you're experiencing:\n\n1. **`skip_name_resolve`**: If this is enabled, MySQL resolves hostnames to IP addresses when checking client connections. If your user permissions are defined with hostnames and this is enabled, it could cause issues if DNS is not resolving correctly.\n\n2. **`max_connections`**: This parameter determines the maximum number of simultaneous client connections. If it's set too low, new connections might be blocked if the limit is reached.\n\n3. **`max_connect_errors`**: This parameter controls how many connection errors are allowed from a host before that host is blocked. If the user has encountered connection errors and exceeded this limit, they might be temporarily blocked.\n\n4. **`connect_timeout`**: This parameter specifies the number of seconds the server waits for a connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'. If your connection is slow or unstable, increasing this might help.\n\n5. **`secure_auth`**: When this is enabled, connections that use old (pre-4.1) authentication protocol are not permitted. Ensure your user is using a compatible authentication method.\n\n6. **`old_passwords`**: This parameter determines the type of password hashing MySQL uses. If set incorrectly, it might prevent users from authenticating with stored passwords that were hashed using a different method.\n\n7. **`default_authentication_plugin`**: This defines the authentication plugin that will be used for new users. If your user was created with a different plugin than what the server expects, there might be issues.\n\n8. **`validate_password_policy`**: If enabled, it enforces a password validation policy which might prevent users from setting or using passwords that don't meet the policy requirements.\n\n9. **`sql_mode`**: This can affect how SQL queries are interpreted and executed. Strict modes can prevent certain types of queries if they don't conform to SQL standards or the specific settings.\n\n10. **`read_only`**: If this is enabled, it allows only users with the SUPER privilege to modify data. This might be why your root user can execute DML/DDL statements but other users cannot.\n\nThese parameters can be checked and adjusted in your MySQL configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini`) or dynamically with the `SET GLOBAL` command in MySQL. However, always ensure to back up your data and understand the implications of changing configuration settings in a production environment."}
