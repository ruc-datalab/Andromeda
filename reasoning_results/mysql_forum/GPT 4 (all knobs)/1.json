{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the performance of imports from a PHPBB forum has significantly slowed down over time on a MySQL 5.7.32 server, here are some recommended parameters to optimize in the `my.cnf` configuration file to potentially improve performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter should be set to a higher value, ideally up to 70-80% of the total RAM when MySQL is the primary service running on the server. Given that the server has 64GB of RAM, setting this to around 45GB (assuming MySQL is the main application) could help, as it allows more data to be held in memory, reducing disk I/O.\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size** and **innodb_log_buffer_size**: Increasing these values can help in handling larger transactions more efficiently by reducing the need for writing log data to disk frequently. Consider setting `innodb_log_file_size` to 1G and `innodb_log_buffer_size` to 64M or 128M.\n\n3. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Setting this to 2 can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file and flushing the log file to disk only once per second. This setting is less safe in terms of data loss if a crash occurs.\n\n4. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This should be set to a value close to twice the number of CPUs if there is high concurrency. For a 12-core server, setting this to 24 might help.\n\n5. **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: These settings should reflect the I/O capability of the storage system. If using SSDs, these can be set higher (e.g., 2000 and 4000 respectively).\n\n6. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: Increasing these values can improve the read and write I/O throughput by allowing more I/O operations to be performed concurrently. Setting each to 16 might be beneficial.\n\n7. **max_connections**: Ensure this is high enough to handle the peak application connections, but not too high as it might lead to excessive memory use. Given the server specs, the current setting of 300 might be adequate unless there are signs of too many connections errors.\n\n8. **query_cache_size** (if applicable in earlier versions before MySQL 5.7.20 where it was deprecated): If still available and not using MySQL 8.0, increasing the query cache size can help performance if the workload involves many identical queries. However, this can also reduce performance if the workload is highly dynamic, as it adds overhead to query execution.\n\n9. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of opening tables frequently. The current setting of 500 might need to be increased if there are many tables being accessed.\n\n10. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Increasing these values allows larger temporary tables in memory, which can improve performance for complex queries that use temporary tables.\n\nHere is the list of parameters to adjust based on the above recommendations:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity\",\n    \"innodb_io_capacity_max\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"table_open_cache\",\n    \"tmp_table_size\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size\"\n]\n```\n\nThese adjustments should be tested in a controlled manner, monitoring the system's response to each change to ensure stability and performance improvements."}
