{"res": "The error message you're encountering, \"#1251 - Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client,\" typically arises when the MySQL server uses a newer authentication protocol that the client software (in this case, possibly your PHP or phpMyAdmin setup) does not support. This often happens with the use of the `caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin, which is the default in MySQL 8.0 and later, but your MySQL version 5 might be configured differently or interacting with newer client software expecting different defaults.\n\nGiven that you are using MySQL version 5 on Windows XP, it's likely that the client software is expecting an older authentication method. Here are the relevant parameters to check and adjust if necessary:\n\n1. **`default_authentication_plugin`** - This parameter determines the authentication plugin that the server uses by default when creating new users. For MySQL 5.7 and earlier, the default is usually `mysql_native_password`.\n\n2. **`secure_auth`** - This option prevents connections to the MySQL server using accounts that have old (pre-4.1) passwords. Ensure this is enabled to use more secure password handling.\n\n3. **`old_passwords`** - This parameter, when set, can cause the server to revert to using older, less secure password hashing algorithms. It should be set to 0 (off) to avoid compatibility issues with newer clients expecting more secure password handling.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you might need to adjust the `default_authentication_plugin` to `mysql_native_password` if it's set to something else, and ensure that `secure_auth` is enabled and `old_passwords` is disabled. Here's how you might adjust these settings in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`):\n\n```ini\n[mysqld]\ndefault_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password\nsecure_auth=ON\nold_passwords=0\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, restart your MySQL server for the changes to take effect. If you're creating new user accounts or if existing accounts continue to have issues, you may need to update the user account passwords using the `ALTER USER` command to ensure they're using the correct hashing algorithm:\n\n```sql\nALTER USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'newpassword';\n```\n\nReplace `'username'` and `'newpassword'` with the actual username and a new password.\n\nHere's the output list of parameters based on your scenario:\n\n```json\n['default_authentication_plugin', 'secure_auth', 'old_passwords']\n```"}
