{"res": "Based on the scenario described, where the dedicated server with more resources (8 processors and 8GB RAM) is experiencing high CPU usage during complex queries involving joins, it seems that the issue might be related to how MySQL is utilizing the available resources and handling the queries. Here are some parameters that could be adjusted to potentially improve performance:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer pool, where data and indexes are cached. Increasing this value can significantly improve performance for read-intensive databases by reducing the need for disk I/O. Given the server has 8GB of RAM, you might want to allocate more memory to the buffer pool, ensuring there's still enough memory left for the operating system and other applications.\n\n2. **join_buffer_size**: This parameter defines the size of the buffer used for joins. Increasing this size can improve the performance of queries that use joins by reducing the need for disk I/O.\n\n3. **sort_buffer_size**: This parameter sets the size of the buffer used for sorting. Queries that involve sorting can benefit from a larger sort buffer.\n\n4. **read_rnd_buffer_size**: This parameter is used after a sort, when reading rows in sorted order. If your queries involve sorting and then retrieving rows in sorted order, adjusting this might help.\n\n5. **thread_cache_size**: This parameter sets the number of threads the server should cache for reuse. Since your server has more CPUs, increasing this value can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.\n\n6. **max_connections**: This parameter defines the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. Although it's set to 100, ensure this is sufficient or increase it if you expect more concurrent connections.\n\n7. **query_cache_size** and **query_cache_limit**: These parameters control the query cache, which stores the result set of queries. However, note that the query cache is deprecated in MySQL 5.7.20 and removed in MySQL 8.0. If you're using an older version, adjusting these might help, but it's generally recommended to rely on other optimizations for newer versions.\n\n8. **innodb_thread_concurrency**: This parameter can be used to limit the number of threads that can run concurrently inside InnoDB. The default value allows MySQL to decide the best number of threads to run based on the workload and the environment.\n\n9. **innodb_read_io_threads** and **innodb_write_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for read and write operations in InnoDB. Increasing these values can improve the performance of I/O-bound workloads.\n\n10. **innodb_log_buffer_size**: This parameter specifies the size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk. A larger size can reduce disk I/O for transactional workloads.\n\nHere's the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size\",\n    \"join_buffer_size\",\n    \"sort_buffer_size\",\n    \"read_rnd_buffer_size\",\n    \"thread_cache_size\",\n    \"max_connections\",\n    \"query_cache_size\",\n    \"query_cache_limit\",\n    \"innodb_thread_concurrency\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads\",\n    \"innodb_log_buffer_size\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjusting these parameters should be done cautiously, monitoring the system's response to each change. It's also recommended to make changes one at a time and observe the impact before proceeding with additional adjustments."}
