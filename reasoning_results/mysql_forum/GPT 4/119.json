{"res": "To achieve the desired query results in MySQL, you will need to use recursive queries to traverse the hierarchical structure of your data. MySQL supports recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) starting from version 8.0. Here are the recommended parameters and SQL features to use:\n\n1. **Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** - This feature allows you to write recursive queries which are essential for traversing hierarchical or tree-structured data. You will use this to recursively find all descendants of a given member in the hierarchy.\n\n2. **WITH RECURSIVE** - This SQL clause is used to define a recursive CTE. You will define a CTE that starts with a specific member and recursively joins to itself to find all descendants.\n\n3. **UNION ALL** - In the recursive CTE, `UNION ALL` is used to combine the initial member with recursive results. This is crucial for including all levels of descendants in the results.\n\n4. **CASE WHEN** - This SQL statement will help in categorizing the descendants into 'Left' or 'Right' based on the 'Side' column in your table.\n\n5. **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** - These clauses will help in organizing the output by sides and in a specific order if required.\n\n6. **Parameters for Recursive Depth Control** - While MySQL handles recursion depth automatically, you might want to control or specify the maximum depth of recursion to prevent excessive resource usage or infinite loops in cases of data anomalies.\n\n7. **Indexes on Center_ID and Referer_ID** - To optimize the recursive queries, especially if the dataset grows, indexing these columns will speed up the join operations within the recursive CTE.\n\nHere is a conceptual example of how you might structure the query using these parameters:\n\n```sql\nWITH RECURSIVE Descendants AS (\n    SELECT Center_ID, Center_Name, Side, 1 AS Level\n    FROM your_table\n    WHERE Center_ID = 'C000006'  -- Starting point, replace with input parameter\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT t.Center_ID, t.Center_Name, CASE\n        WHEN d.Side = 'Left' THEN 'Left'\n        WHEN d.Side = 'Right' THEN 'Right'\n        ELSE d.Side\n    END AS Side, Level + 1\n    FROM your_table t\n    JOIN Descendants d ON t.Referer_ID = d.Center_ID\n)\nSELECT Side, COUNT(*) AS Members, GROUP_CONCAT(Center_Name ORDER BY Level) AS Names\nFROM Descendants\nWHERE Center_ID != 'C000006'  -- Exclude the starting member\nGROUP BY Side;\n```\n\nThis query setup will help you retrieve the left and right side members based on a given `Center_ID`. Adjust the starting `Center_ID` in the CTE to match the user's input."}
