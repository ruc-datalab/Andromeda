{"res": "Based on the details provided and the need to optimize the query performance, particularly focusing on reducing the use of temporary tables and file sorting, here are the recommended MySQL server parameters to adjust:\n\n1. **`sort_buffer_size`**: Increase this size to allow more space for sorting operations in memory, which can help avoid using on-disk filesort. However, be cautious as setting this too high for many connections can exhaust system memory.\n\n2. **`read_rnd_buffer_size`**: Increasing this buffer can improve the efficiency of reading rows that are sorted by order. This is particularly useful after a sort operation.\n\n3. **`join_buffer_size`**: This parameter increases the size of the buffer used for joins that do not use indexes. Since your query involves multiple joins, increasing this might help.\n\n4. **`tmp_table_size`** and **`max_heap_table_size`**: You've already set these to 64M, but depending on the query load and the temporary data volume, you might need to increase these values. Ensure both are set to the same value to avoid confusion and inefficiency.\n\n5. **`key_buffer_size`**: Since you are using MyISAM tables, increasing this value will allocate more memory for indexing, which can speed up index scans and lookups.\n\n6. **`myisam_sort_buffer_size`**: As your tables are MyISAM, increasing this buffer size can help speed up index creation during heavy updates or bulk inserts.\n\n7. **`query_cache_size`**: If not already enabled and configured, setting up a query cache can help with read-heavy workloads by caching the result set of frequent queries.\n\n8. **`table_open_cache`**: Increasing this value can reduce the overhead of opening tables frequently, which is beneficial if your application accesses many tables.\n\n9. **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Although your tables are MyISAM, if any part of your database uses InnoDB, increasing this parameter will allocate more memory to InnoDB to cache data and indexes of InnoDB tables.\n\n10. **`innodb_log_buffer_size`**: For InnoDB tables, increasing this size can reduce disk I/O by holding more data in the buffer before writing it to the log file.\n\nThese recommendations are aimed at optimizing the specific query and overall database performance, considering the provided database configuration and server specifications. Always monitor the system's performance and adjust these parameters gradually, testing the impact of each change."}
