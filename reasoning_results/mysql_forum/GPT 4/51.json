{"res": "Based on the error logs and the issues described, it seems like the MySQL database, particularly InnoDB, is experiencing corruption or inconsistencies likely due to the abrupt power failure. Here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your MySQL configuration to help manage and potentially resolve these issues:\n\n1. `innodb_force_recovery`: Set this parameter to a value between 1 and 6 to force the InnoDB recovery at different levels. Start with a lower level (e.g., 1 or 2) and increase if necessary to allow the server to start so you can dump tables. Be cautious with higher levels as they can discard data.\n\n2. `innodb_recovery_update_relay_log`: Enable this if you are using replication and need to recover from a corrupted relay log.\n\n3. `innodb_purge_threads`: Increase the number of threads dedicated to purging old versions of rows. This might help with the \"purge reached the head of the history list\" warning.\n\n4. `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: Consider increasing this value if your server has enough memory, as it allows more data to be stored in RAM, reducing disk I/O and potentially mitigating issues during recovery processes.\n\n5. `innodb_log_file_size` and `innodb_log_buffer_size`: Increase these parameters to provide more space for InnoDB log files and buffer, which can help in handling larger transactions and recovery processes.\n\n6. `max_allowed_packet`: Increase this value to allow larger packets, which might help prevent disconnections during large operations like `mysqldump`.\n\n7. `net_read_timeout` and `net_write_timeout`: Increase these timeout settings to avoid server disconnections during long-running queries or maintenance operations.\n\n8. `innodb_file_per_table`: Enable this to store InnoDB tables in separate files. This can help isolate corruption to individual tables and simplify recovery.\n\nPlease ensure to back up your data before making these changes, and apply them cautiously, testing each change's impact on your system's stability and data integrity."}
