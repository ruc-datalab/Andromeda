{"res": "Based on the provided configuration and the symptoms of the slowdown in import performance, here are some recommended parameters to adjust in your `my.cnf` file to potentially improve the performance of your MySQL server:\n\n1. **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: This parameter should be set to a larger value, especially since you have 64GB of RAM. This buffer pool is where data and indexes are cached; having it too low can cause significant slowdowns due to disk I/O. For a 64GB system, setting this to around 48G (75% of system RAM) could be beneficial if MySQL is the primary application.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    innodb_buffer_pool_size = 48G\n    ```\n\n2. **innodb_log_file_size**: Increase the size of the log file to support larger transactions, which can be beneficial during imports. A larger log file size can handle bigger transactions without needing to write to the disk as often.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    innodb_log_file_size = 1G\n    ```\n\n3. **innodb_write_io_threads** and **innodb_read_io_threads**: These parameters control the number of I/O threads for write and read operations in InnoDB. Increasing these may improve performance especially on a multi-core system.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    innodb_write_io_threads = 16\n    innodb_read_io_threads = 16\n    ```\n\n4. **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Setting this to 2 can improve performance by writing the log buffer to the log file and flushing the log file to disk once per second. This setting trades a slight risk (data loss if MySQL crashes) for improved speed.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\n    ```\n\n5. **max_connections**: Ensure this setting is high enough to handle your concurrent connections, but not too high as it can lead to excessive memory use.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    max_connections = 500\n    ```\n\n6. **query_cache_size** (if applicable): For MySQL 5.7, the query cache is deprecated, but if you are using an older version, adjusting the query cache size can sometimes yield performance benefits. However, for most write-heavy database loads, it's better to have it disabled.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    query_cache_size = 0\n    ```\n\n7. **tmp_table_size** and **max_heap_table_size**: Increase these values to prevent temporary tables from being created on disk during complex queries, which is slower than in-memory operations.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    tmp_table_size = 256M\n    max_heap_table_size = 256M\n    ```\n\n8. **table_open_cache**: Increasing this value can reduce the number of disk I/O operations by caching more table descriptors.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    table_open_cache = 2000\n    ```\n\nHere is the list of recommended parameters to adjust:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"innodb_buffer_pool_size = 48G\",\n    \"innodb_log_file_size = 1G\",\n    \"innodb_write_io_threads = 16\",\n    \"innodb_read_io_threads = 16\",\n    \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\",\n    \"max_connections = 500\",\n    \"query_cache_size = 0\",\n    \"tmp_table_size = 256M\",\n    \"max_heap_table_size = 256M\",\n    \"table_open_cache = 2000\"\n]\n```\n\nAdjust these parameters carefully, monitor the system's performance after each change, and revert if any negative impacts occur."}
